## Features

Fast, grid-based A\* routing with a native Rust core (~10× faster than pure Python): octilinear (H/V/45°) multi-layer routing with automatic vias, and batch routing with incremental obstacle caching. Highlights below link to the full deep-dive docs.

**Core routing**
- Rust-accelerated A\* pathfinding, multi-layer with automatic via insertion
- [Rip-up and reroute](docs/rip-up-reroute.md) — progressive N+1 blocker analysis, ripped-corridor avoidance
- [Net ordering strategies](docs/net-ordering.md) — MPS (crossing-aware), inside-out, or original, with MPS layer swaps
- Stub layer switching, vertical track alignment, turn-cost straightening
- Board-edge (Edge.Cuts arcs/cutouts), keep-out rule areas, and auto BGA exclusion zones — see [Configuration](docs/configuration.md)
- Direction-aware stub / BGA / track [proximity penalties](docs/configuration.md)

**Differential pairs** — see [Differential Pairs](docs/differential-pairs.md)
- Pose-based A\* with a Dubins heuristic and adaptive setback angles for orientation-aware centerlines
- Bare-pad, multi-point (3+ terminals), and hybrid (coupled middle + single-ended legs) routing
- Automatic polarity resolution (opt-in pad swaps), U-turn prevention, GND return-via placement
- Electrically-short legs auto-defer to single-ended; per-layer [impedance-controlled](docs/differential-pairs.md) widths

**Power & planes** — see [Plane Routing](docs/route-plane.md) and [Power Nets](docs/power-nets.md)
- [Wider power-net routing](docs/power-nets.md) with automatic neck-down at fine-pitch pads
- Plane pours (pads are welded by the route step, #562) and multi-net Voronoi plane layers with resistance / max-current reporting
- Disconnected-plane-region repair (region joins + pad taps) and GND return-via placement

**Signal integrity**
- [Length matching](docs/length-matching.md) — trombone meanders, auto DQ/DQS grouping, via-barrel aware
- [Time matching](docs/length-matching.md#time-matching) — propagation delay, microstrip vs stripline
- [Bus routing](docs/bus-routing.md), plus [guide corridors and keep-out zones](docs/configuration.md) drawn on a User layer

**Placement, fanout & optimization**
- [Placement optimization](docs/placement-optimization.md) for routability, before routing
- [Floorplan intent, graded](docs/floorplan-intent.md) — declare where parts belong and check the board against it, so "the render looks fine" stops being a verdict
- BGA / QFN fanout with decoupling-cap placement cleanup, Hungarian target-swap, and schematic sync

**Cleanup & verification** — see [Utilities](docs/utilities.md)
- Post-route copper cleanup reconciled against the connectivity model (no orphaned or ripped-and-not-restored copper), with gap-snap connectors
- **KiCad-oracle reconnect** — routes the exact links KiCad's own DRC reports as unconnected
- Checkers for DRC, connectivity, orphan stubs, copper hygiene (`check_weird.py`), and pad geometry

**Interfaces**
- Full [KiCad plugin GUI](#kicad-plugin) (KiCad 9 & 10) and a scriptable [CLI](#command-line-interface)
- [AI assistance](docs/claude-skills.md) — a **AI tab** that plans an entire routing workflow, per-field "Ask AI" helpers, and datasheet-driven power / high-speed / diff-pair analysis
- [Board rendering & routing animation](docs/route-animation.md) — fast geometry PNG renderer, plus a movie of the router laying/ripping/restoring copper (`make_movie.py`, or the Advanced options tab's **Make routing movie** debug checkbox → `.mp4`/`.gif`)
- [Routing plans as files](docs/claude-skills.md#plans-from-the-command-line) — save/load a whole routing chain as JSON: build one from a recorded command chain (`make_plan.py`), run it headless through the real plugin (`run_plan.py`), or load it in the GUI

## Quick Start

### 1. Get the Code

```bash
# Clone with git
git clone https://github.com/drandyhaas/KiCadRoutingTools.git
cd KiCadRoutingTools
```

Or [download the ZIP](https://github.com/drandyhaas/KiCadRoutingTools/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) and extract it.

### 2. Install the Rust Router

```bash
python build_router.py
```

By default this downloads a prebuilt binary for your OS from the project's
[GitHub Releases](https://github.com/drandyhaas/KiCadRoutingTools/releases) —
**no Rust toolchain required**. Prebuilts are published for:

- Linux x86_64
- macOS arm64 (Apple Silicon)
- macOS x86_64 (Intel)
- Windows x86_64

If a prebuilt isn't available for your platform (e.g. Linux arm64) or the
download fails, the script falls back to building locally with cargo.

#### Building from source (optional)

If you'd rather build locally — or you're on a platform without a prebuilt —
install Rust from [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/):

```bash
# macOS / Linux
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh

# Windows: Download and run rustup-init.exe from https://rustup.rs/
```

After installation, restart your terminal or run `source ~/.cargo/env`, then:

```bash
python build_router.py --from-source     # build locally instead of downloading
python build_router.py --tag v0.15.0     # download a specific release
python build_router.py --clean           # remove all build artifacts
```

### 3. Choose Your Interface

**Option A: KiCad Plugin (Recommended for interactive use)**

```bash
# Install the plugin
python install_plugin.py

# Then in KiCad: Tools → External Plugins → KiCadRoutingTools
```

**Option B: Claude Code (AI-assisted routing)**

Use [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/claude-code) to analyze your PCB and generate a routing plan:

```
> /plan-pcb-routing kicad_files/my_board.kicad_pcb
```

Claude will:
- Analyze your board structure and identify components needing fanout (BGA/QFN/PGA)
- Detect differential pairs and DDR signals requiring length matching
- Identify power/ground nets and recommend plane vs trace routing
- Assess signal speeds and recommend GND return via placement
- Generate a step-by-step routing plan with explanations
- Run the commands and verify results

Other useful skills:
```
> /find-high-speed-nets kicad_files/my_board.kicad_pcb       # Identify high-speed nets via datasheet lookup
> /analyze-power-nets kicad_files/my_board.kicad_pcb         # Identify power nets and track widths
> /identify-diff-pairs kicad_files/my_board.kicad_pcb        # Find diff pairs by pin function, recommend gap/impedance
> /recommend-stackup kicad_files/my_board.kicad_pcb          # Stackup advice for impedance/time-matching accuracy
> /diagnose-routing-failures my_board.kicad_pcb /tmp/route_output.txt  # Root-cause failed routes, get a retry command
> /review-routed-board my_board_routed.kicad_pcb             # Post-route QA: DRC, connectivity, length match, GND vias
```

See [Claude Skills](docs/claude-skills.md) for what each skill does and how they fit together.

All of these are also available inside KiCad without leaving the plugin - see [AI assistance in the plugin](#ai-assistance-ai-tab) below. The plugin can run the same skills through [opencode](https://opencode.ai) instead of Claude Code (issue #503) - a Backend dropdown on the AI tab selects the agent CLI, and opencode's `provider/model` strings open the door to other model providers. The skills' output contracts are tuned on Claude models; smaller models may follow them less reliably.

**Option C: Manual Command Line (For scripting and automation)**

```bash
# Optionally optimize an existing placement for routability (before routing)
python py_placer/place_optimize.py my_board.kicad_pcb --max-displacement 3

# Pour the planes FIRST (#562): the fanout's plane-drop vias then land on
# real fill, and the route step welds plane pads into it.
python py_router/route_planes.py my_board.kicad_pcb poured.kicad_pcb --nets GND --plane-layers B.Cu

# Fan out a BGA, then tidy decoupling caps off the new vias (issue #130)
python py_router/bga_fanout.py poured.kicad_pcb -c U1 -o fanned.kicad_pcb --clearance 0.1
python py_placer/place_fanout_clearance.py fanned.kicad_pcb capclean.kicad_pcb --clearance 0.1

# Route differential pairs
python py_router/route_diff.py capclean.kicad_pcb -o diffed.kicad_pcb --nets "*lvds*"

# Route ALL remaining nets, plane nets included (their widths via --power-nets).
# This step ends with the in-run plane finalize that completes the planes.
python py_router/route.py diffed.kicad_pcb routed.kicad_pcb --nets "*" \
    --power-nets GND --power-nets-widths 0.3
```

---

## KiCad Plugin

The plugin provides a full graphical interface for all routing features, running directly within KiCad 9 or 10.

### AI assistance (AI tab)

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/claude_tab.png" alt="AI tab: planned steps, controls, and live transcript" width="700">
</p>

With [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/claude-code) or [opencode](https://opencode.ai) installed, the routing dialog gains AI assistance throughout (the plugin spawns the selected agent CLI headless, streams a live transcript, and fills GUI controls from the results). The **Backend** dropdown on the AI tab picks the CLI: Claude Code runs Anthropic models; opencode takes `provider/model` strings for many providers (including its built-in free tier), with `opencode auth login` adding provider accounts. Both discover the same `.claude/skills/`; opencode runs them under a read-only `pcb-analysis` agent defined in `opencode.json` (the equivalent of the Claude run's read-only tool allowlist):

- **AI tab** - *Plan Routing* runs `/plan-pcb-routing`: the plan fills the parameter fields across the tabs and appears as a checkable step list, which *Run Selected Steps* executes sequentially in-process on the live board with per-step status marks. *Review Routed Board* and *Diagnose Routing Failures* give post-route QA and failure root-causing. Backend, model, and effort selectors control every AI run and persist with the dialog settings (model/effort remembered per backend).
- **Save / Load a plan** - *Save…* writes the generated step list to a JSON file; *Load…* reads one back and runs it with **no Claude call** — handy for replaying a workflow that worked on another board. A recorded stress-test chain converts to a loadable plan too (`tests/stress/manifest_to_plan.py <board>/redo_commands.sh plan.json`).
- **Per-field "Ask AI" buttons** - power nets/widths (Route tab), stackup check (Layers), differential-pair verification by pin function (Differential tab), net-to-plane layer mappings and GND return via distance (Planes tab).

The full button-to-skill map is in [Claude Skills - Plugin GUI Integration](docs/claude-skills.md#plugin-gui-integration). Datasheet-based skills use web lookups and take a few minutes; every run shows a live transcript with cancel.

### Installation

Three ways to install:

**A. KiCad Plugin and Content Manager (PCM)** — the recommended path for end users. Open the PCM from the KiCad main window, find *KiCad Routing Tools*, and click Install. (The package is in the process of being added to the official repository; once accepted, this will be available out-of-the-box.) On first launch, the plugin checks the Python packages listed in `requirements.txt` (currently `scipy` and `shapely` — KiCad already bundles `numpy`) and offers a one-click pip install for any that are missing into KiCad's Python.

**B. PCM "Install from File…" using the release zip** — works today, before the package lands in the official repository. Each [GitHub Release](https://github.com/drandyhaas/KiCadRoutingTools/releases) ships a ready-to-install PCM package zip named `KiCadRoutingTools-<version>.zip` (a single cross-platform archive bundling the prebuilt Rust binaries for all platforms — **not** the auto-generated "Source code (zip)"). To install it:

1. From the Release's *Assets*, download `KiCadRoutingTools-<version>.zip` (e.g. `KiCadRoutingTools-0.15.13.zip`).
2. In KiCad, open **Plugin and Content Manager** from the main window.
3. Click **Install from File…** (bottom of the PCM dialog) and select the downloaded zip.
4. Click **Apply Pending Changes**, then restart KiCad if prompted.

The plugin appears under *Tools → External Plugins* in the PCB Editor. The same first-launch `scipy`/`shapely` dependency check described in (A) applies. This path keeps the plugin manageable from the PCM (you can update or uninstall it there), unlike the manual install below.

**C. Manual install from source** — for development or for using the CLI tools as well:

```bash
# Install the plugin (copies to KiCad plugins directory)
python install_plugin.py

# For development: create symlink instead of copying
python install_plugin.py --symlink

# Remove the plugin
python install_plugin.py --uninstall
```

The installer automatically detects your KiCad installation directory (supports KiCad 9.0 and 10.0):
- **macOS**: `~/Documents/KiCad/<version>/3rdparty/plugins/`
- **Linux**: `~/.local/share/kicad/<version>/3rdparty/plugins/`
- **Windows**: `~/Documents/KiCad/<version>/3rdparty/plugins/`

If you previously installed this plugin through the Plugin & Content Manager, that copy sits next to the local install and would shadow it on `sys.path` (causing stale-code errors). The installer detects any such PCM copy and moves it aside to `<kicad-base>/disabled_pcm_plugins/<version>/`, leaving it recoverable. Pass `--keep-pcm` to skip this.

### Releasing a new version (maintainers)

The full release flow — version bump, GitHub Release, and the merge request to the official KiCad PCM repository — is documented step by step in **[docs/release-pipeline.md](docs/release-pipeline.md)**.

Short version:

1. Bump `VERSION` and the `versions[]` entry in `metadata.json`.
2. `git tag v0.15.6 && git push --tags` — CI builds all 4 platform binaries, packages a single `KiCadRoutingTools-<ver>.zip` (the PCM validator rejects duplicate version strings, so we ship one cross-platform zip), patches `metadata.json` with real sha256/size values, and attaches everything to the GitHub Release.
3. Append the new version to the metadata file in your fork of `gitlab.com/kicad/addons/metadata` and open an MR. See the docs page for the exact commands.

To build a zip locally for testing:

```bash
python package_pcm.py --binary-dir ./path/to/release/artifacts
```

### Usage

1. Open KiCad (9.0 or later)
2. Open a PCB in Pcbnew
3. *(Optional)* Select one or more nets in the PCB editor first — for example by
   clicking tracks/pads, or right-clicking a track and choosing
   **Select → All Tracks in Net**. Any nets you have selected are automatically
   pre-checked for routing when the plugin opens.
4. Go to **Tools → External Plugins → KiCadRoutingTools**
5. Configure routing parameters and select (or adjust) the nets to route
6. Click **Route** to run the router

### Plugin Tabs

**Route Tab:**
- Net selection with filtering and component filtering
- Nets selected in the PCB editor before opening the plugin are pre-checked automatically (also applies to the Fanout, Planes, and Differential tabs)
- Option to separate nets by net class (organizes into tabs per class)
- Track width, clearance, via size/drill from net class or manual override
- Layer selection with per-layer cost multipliers
- Options: stub layer swaps, copper text moving, teardrops, power net widths, no-BGA zones
- **Guide corridor** - draw a polyline on a User layer (e.g. `User.1`) and tick "Follow User-layer guide path" to route the selected nets along it (waypoints, avoiding obstacles, packed non-overlapping)
- **Keepout zones** - draw one or more closed polygons on a User layer (e.g. `User.2`) and tick "Keep out of User-layer polygon(s)" to keep routed tracks out of those areas (hard keepout, all routed nets)
- **Clear guide/keepout layers** - optional "Clear guide layer after routing" / "Clear keepout layer after routing" checkboxes (unchecked by default) delete the drawn guide/keepout graphics from their User layer after a successful route, so you can draw fresh ones for the next run

**Advanced options Tab:**
- Swappable nets configuration for target swap optimization
- Routing parameters: iterations, heuristic weight, rip-up, probe iterations
- MPS ordering options, direction control, length matching
- Proximity settings: BGA, stub, track, via proximity costs
- Debug options

**Differential Tab:**
- Differential pair selection with filtering
- Pair gap, turning radius, setback angle configuration
- Options: polarity fix, GND vias, intra-pair length matching

**Fanout Tab:**
- BGA fanout with exit margin, escape direction, differential pair support
- Under-pad escape option for dense, fully-populated BGAs the channel router can't escape (issue #122) — see [BGA Fanout](py_router/bga_fanout/README.md#escape-methods)
- "Optimize decoupling cap placement" option (off by default) — after fanout, nudges decoupling caps off foreign-net fanout vias and toward same-net balls (issue #130) — see [Placement](py_placer/placement/README.md#place_fanout_clearancepy--decoupling-cap-clearance-repair-issue-130)
- QFN fanout with extension length configuration
- Net selection for fanout operations

**Planes Tab** (pour creation only since #562 — plane repair runs inside
every route, and the route step welds plane pads into the pour):
- Net-to-layer assignment for power/ground planes
- Create the pours (plus thermal via arrays under exposed pads)
- Area via stitching and GND return via placement near signal vias
- Via size/drill, zone clearance configuration

**Log Tab:**
- Real-time routing output display
- Color-coded messages (errors, warnings, success)

**About Tab:**
- Version information and credits

**General Features:**
- Settings persistence (parameters and selections preserved between sessions)
- Cancel button to stop routing operations mid-progress
- Results applied directly to the open PCB in KiCad

## Command-Line Interface

### Net Pattern Syntax

All `--nets` options support fnmatch-style wildcards and exclusion patterns:

| Pattern | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `*` | All nets |
| `*DATA*` | Nets containing "DATA" |
| `/*` | Nets starting with "/" (hierarchical) |
| `Net-(U1-*)` | Nets matching "Net-(U1-...)" |
| `!GND` | Exclude net named "GND" |
| `!*VCC*` | Exclude nets containing "VCC" |
| `"*" "!GND" "!VCC"` | All nets except GND and VCC |

**Notes:**
- Exclusion patterns (starting with `!`) remove matching nets from the result
- Order matters: include patterns add nets, exclude patterns remove them
- Nets starting with "unconnected-" are automatically excluded
- Use quotes around patterns with special characters

### Route Nets

```bash
# Route all nets (default) - outputs to input_routed.kicad_pcb
python py_router/route.py kicad_files/input.kicad_pcb

# Route all nets, overwrite input file
python py_router/route.py kicad_files/input.kicad_pcb --overwrite

# Route all nets to a specific output file
python py_router/route.py kicad_files/input.kicad_pcb kicad_files/output.kicad_pcb

# Route specific nets (using --nets option)
python py_router/route.py kicad_files/input.kicad_pcb kicad_files/output.kicad_pcb --nets "Net-(U2A-DATA_0)" "Net-(U2A-DATA_1)"

# Route with wildcard patterns
python py_router/route.py kicad_files/input.kicad_pcb kicad_files/output.kicad_pcb --nets "Net-(U2A-DATA_*)"

# Route all nets on a component (auto-excludes GND/VCC/VDD/unconnected)
python py_router/route.py kicad_files/input.kicad_pcb kicad_files/output.kicad_pcb --component U1

# Route specific patterns on a component (no auto-exclusion)
python py_router/route.py kicad_files/input.kicad_pcb kicad_files/output.kicad_pcb --nets "/DDAT*" --component U1

# Route ALL nets on a component including power (use "*" pattern)
python py_router/route.py kicad_files/input.kicad_pcb kicad_files/output.kicad_pcb --nets "*" --component U1

# Exclusion-pattern SYNTAX demo (! prefix). NOTE: in the #562 chain you do
# NOT exclude plane nets from the route step -- see the chain example below.
python py_router/route.py kicad_files/input.kicad_pcb kicad_files/output.kicad_pcb --nets "*" "!GND" "!VCC"

# Route one placement BLOCK -- a schematic sheet, a KiCad group, an IC and its decaps
# (see "Placement blocks" below for what --group-by can infer, and --list-groups)
python py_router/route.py kicad_files/input.kicad_pcb kicad_files/output.kicad_pcb \
  --group-by sheet --list-groups                      # what blocks exist?
python py_router/route.py kicad_files/input.kicad_pcb kicad_files/output.kicad_pcb \
  --group sheet:558c3023 --group-by sheet --group-scope internal

# PREVIEW any routing run: route it, report what it WOULD add, write no board
python py_router/route.py kicad_files/input.kicad_pcb kicad_files/output.kicad_pcb \
  --group sheet:558c3023 --group-by sheet --preview --preview-png preview.png

# UNDO: strip the scoped nets' copper back to unrouted (needs an explicit scope;
# defaults to --group-scope internal, since a block's "touching" nets include
# GND/VCC and undoing those would strip their copper across the whole board)
python py_router/route.py kicad_files/input.kicad_pcb kicad_files/undone.kicad_pcb \
  --group sheet:558c3023 --group-by sheet --undo

# Route differential pairs (use route_diff.py)
python py_router/route_diff.py kicad_files/input.kicad_pcb kicad_files/output.kicad_pcb --nets "*lvds*" --no-bga-zones

# Route with wider tracks for power nets
python py_router/route.py kicad_files/input.kicad_pcb kicad_files/output.kicad_pcb --nets "Net*" \
  --power-nets "*GND*" "*VCC*" "+3.3V" --power-nets-widths 0.4 0.5 0.3 --track-width 0.2

# Typical workflow: create GND plane first, then route all signals
python py_router/route_planes.py kicad_files/flat_hierarchy.kicad_pcb --nets GND --plane-layers B.Cu
python py_router/route.py kicad_files/flat_hierarchy_routed.kicad_pcb --overwrite
```

### 3. Create Power/Ground Planes

```bash
# Create GND zone on B.Cu with via connections to all GND pads (outputs to input_routed.kicad_pcb)
python py_router/route_planes.py kicad_files/input.kicad_pcb --nets GND --plane-layers B.Cu

# Create GND zone, overwrite input file
python py_router/route_planes.py kicad_files/input.kicad_pcb --overwrite --nets GND --plane-layers B.Cu

# Create GND zone to specific output file
python py_router/route_planes.py kicad_files/input.kicad_pcb kicad_files/output.kicad_pcb --nets GND --plane-layers B.Cu

# Create multiple planes at once (each net paired with corresponding plane layer)
python py_router/route_planes.py kicad_files/input.kicad_pcb --nets GND +3.3V --plane-layers In1.Cu In2.Cu

# Create VCC plane with larger vias
python py_router/route_planes.py kicad_files/input.kicad_pcb --nets VCC --plane-layers In2.Cu --via-size 0.5 --via-drill 0.4

# Pour planes (the pour places no taps: the route step welds plane pads)
python py_router/route_planes.py kicad_files/input.kicad_pcb --nets GND +3.3V --plane-layers In1.Cu In2.Cu

# Multiple nets sharing same layer via Voronoi partitioning (use | separator)
python py_router/route_planes.py kicad_files/input.kicad_pcb --nets GND "VA19|VA11" --plane-layers In4.Cu In5.Cu

# Dry run to see what would be placed
python py_router/route_planes.py kicad_files/input.kicad_pcb --nets GND --plane-layers B.Cu --dry-run
```

### 3b. Repair Disconnected Plane Regions

> **Since #562 you normally do not run this step.** Every `route.py` run
> finishes with an in-run *plane finalize* that applies this same engine
> (pad taps + region joins), the plane-copper cleanup, and a KiCad-oracle
> completion check — so a pours-first chain repairs its planes automatically.
> `KICAD_PLANE_FINALIZE=0` is the kill switch. Use the standalone script
> below for a board routed OUTSIDE that chain (e.g. hand-edited copper).

After creating power planes, regions may become split by vias and traces from other nets. Use `repair_planes.py` to reconnect them:

```bash
# Auto-detect all zones in PCB and repair disconnected regions (outputs to input_routed.kicad_pcb)
python py_router/repair_planes.py kicad_files/input.kicad_pcb

# Auto-detect all zones, overwrite input
python py_router/repair_planes.py kicad_files/input.kicad_pcb --overwrite

# Auto-detect all zones to specific output file
python py_router/repair_planes.py kicad_files/input.kicad_pcb kicad_files/output.kicad_pcb

# Specific nets and layers
python py_router/repair_planes.py kicad_files/input.kicad_pcb --nets GND --plane-layers B.Cu

# Customize track width and clearance
python py_router/repair_planes.py kicad_files/input.kicad_pcb kicad_files/output.kicad_pcb \
    --track-width 0.5 --clearance 0.2
```

### 3c. Review a Placement (issue #431)

Placement deltas are invisible in a board file; render them instead.

```bash
# what moved, and did it help? (ghosts at the seed poses, arrows, metrics caption)
python3 py_tools/render_placement.py placed.kicad_pcb --before seed.kicad_pcb -o delta.png

# zoom to one placement block; same block names as route.py --group
python3 py_tools/render_placement.py board.kicad_pcb --list-groups --group-by sheet
python3 py_tools/render_placement.py board.kicad_pcb --zoom-group sheet:58d913ec --per-side -o out/

# which parts should NOT be moved -- advice only, locks nothing, writes no board
python3 py_placer/place_optimize.py board.kicad_pcb --suggest-locks
```

Toggles for `--borders` / `--labels` / `--ratsnest` / `--arrows` / `--ghosts`;
`--per-side` gives F and B panels rather than one flattened projection.
The render is triage -- the verdict is the caption's `crossings` / `hpwl`.

### 4. Verify Results

```bash
# Check for DRC violations. With no -c, grades at the clearance the routing
# steps wrote into the sibling .kicad_pro (the smallest clearance any step
# actually used); falls back to 0.2mm if there's no project. Pass -c to override.
python py_router/check_drc.py kicad_files/output.kicad_pcb

# Cross-check with KiCad's own DRC engine (requires KiCad; --refill-zones avoids
# bogus zone-clearance errors from stale pours - see tests/README.md for details)
kicad-cli pcb drc --refill-zones --format json -o drc.json kicad_files/output.kicad_pcb

# Check connectivity (detects unrouted nets, broken routes, and T-junctions)
python py_router/check_connected.py kicad_files/output.kicad_pcb

# Check connectivity for specific nets
python py_router/check_connected.py kicad_files/output.kicad_pcb --nets "*DATA*"

# Check connectivity for all nets on a component
python py_router/check_connected.py kicad_files/output.kicad_pcb --component U1

# Only check routed nets (skip unrouted net detection)
python py_router/check_connected.py kicad_files/output.kicad_pcb --routed-only

# Check for orphan stubs (dead-end traces with no pad/via/trace at the loose end).
# Connection is judged by actual copper extent (via radius, pad size, trace
# half-width), so T-junction taps and copper-overlap joints are not miscounted.
python py_tools/check_orphan_stubs.py kicad_files/output.kicad_pcb

# Pad-geometry sanity check: flags same-footprint, different-net pads whose copper
# overlaps (a short). A non-zero result almost always means a pad's rotation/size
# is modelled wrong - the usual cause is a QFN/QFP/BGA placed at a non-orthogonal
# angle. The fanout tools run this automatically on their component first; run it
# yourself before fanout (or board-wide) as a standalone check:
python py_router/check_pads.py kicad_files/board.kicad_pcb                 # whole board, per footprint
python py_router/check_pads.py kicad_files/board.kicad_pcb --component U23 # one footprint
python py_router/check_pads.py kicad_files/board.kicad_pcb --cross-footprint  # also across parts

# Flag long non-orthonormal tracks. An on-grid router emits only 0/45/90-degree
# segments; the only legitimate non-orthonormal segment is a short (<=1 grid cell)
# terminal connector to an off-grid pad/ball. Anything longer is a routing defect
# (it can cut diagonally across foreign copper). qfn_fanout escape stubs are
# excluded automatically; bga_fanout's short stub-end jogs clear the 0.25mm default.
python py_tools/check_orthonormal.py kicad_files/output.kicad_pcb

# Copper hygiene (read-only): dangling stubs, same-net soft joints, redundant
# cycles, and removable / stacked / floating copper the routing left behind.
python py_router/check_weird.py kicad_files/output.kicad_pcb
```

See [Utilities](docs/utilities.md) for every checker and its options.

### 5. Power Net Analysis

Use the `/analyze-power-nets` skill to identify power nets and get track width recommendations:

```
# Ask the AI to analyze your board with datasheet lookup
/analyze-power-nets kicad_files/my_board.kicad_pcb
```

The skill:
1. Auto-classifies obvious components (resistors, capacitors, inductors, etc.)
2. Uses WebSearch to look up datasheets for unknown components (ICs, connectors, transistors)
3. Classifies each component's role (power source, current sink, pass-through, shunt)
4. Traces power paths from sinks to sources
5. Generates ready-to-use `--power-nets` configurations

See [Power Net Analysis](docs/power-nets.md) for detailed documentation.

### 6. High-Speed Net Analysis

Use the `/find-high-speed-nets` skill to identify high-speed nets and get GND return via recommendations:

```
# Ask the AI to analyze signal speeds with datasheet lookup
/find-high-speed-nets kicad_files/my_board.kicad_pcb
```

The skill:
1. Pre-classifies nets by name patterns (DDR, USB, SPI, CLK, etc.)
2. Pre-classifies components by footprint (FPGA, DDR, PHY, etc.)
3. Uses WebSearch to look up datasheets for ICs and extract max clock rates and rise times
4. Traces high-speed signals through series passives (termination resistors, AC coupling caps)
5. Generates a speed classification (ultra-high/high/medium/low) with recommended `--gnd-via-distance`

The `/plan-pcb-routing` skill includes a lightweight version of this analysis (net name and
footprint pattern matching only, no datasheet lookup) and automatically includes a GND return
via step when GND planes are present. Run `/find-high-speed-nets` first for more accurate
recommendations based on actual component specifications.

### 7. Integration Tests

```bash
# Run full integration test (fanout + routing + checks)
python tests/test_fanout_and_route.py --all

# Quick mode for faster testing
python tests/test_fanout_and_route.py --all --quick
```

See [tests/README.md](tests/README.md) for detailed documentation of all test scripts.

## Performance

Integration test results (`tests/test_fanout_and_route.py`):

Rust acceleration provides ~10x speedup vs pure Python.

## Command Reference

Every tool prints its full option list with `--help`, and **[docs/configuration.md](docs/configuration.md)** is the single source of truth for the flags — defaults, guidance, and which tool each applies to. The tool-specific guides go deeper on their area:

| Tool | Purpose | Guide |
|------|---------|-------|
| `route.py` | Single-ended routing | [Configuration](docs/configuration.md) |
| `route_diff.py` | Differential-pair routing | [Differential Pairs](docs/differential-pairs.md) |
| `route_planes.py` | Power/ground plane via connections | [Plane Routing](docs/route-plane.md) |
| `repair_planes.py` | Plane region repair + pad taps | [Plane Routing](docs/route-plane.md) |
| `bga_fanout.py` / `qfn_fanout.py` | BGA / QFN escape fanout | [BGA](py_router/bga_fanout/README.md) · [QFN](py_router/qfn_fanout/README.md) · [Utilities](docs/utilities.md) |
| `place_fanout_clearance.py` | Move decoupling caps off fanout vias | [Utilities](docs/utilities.md) |
| `place_optimize.py` | Placement for routability | [Placement Optimization](docs/placement-optimization.md) |
| `check_floorplan.py` | Grade a board against a declared floorplan intent | [Floorplan Intent](docs/floorplan-intent.md) |
| `check_*.py` | DRC / connectivity / hygiene / pad checks | [Utilities](docs/utilities.md) |
| `make_movie.py` | Movie of a routing run (`.mp4`/`.gif`) | [Rendering & animation](docs/route-animation.md) |
| `make_plan.py` / `run_plan.py` | Build a GUI routing plan from a recorded chain / run one headless | [Plans from the CLI](docs/claude-skills.md#plans-from-the-command-line) |

```bash
# Full option list for any tool
python py_router/route.py --help

# A typical chain (#562 pours-first): pour, then diff pairs, then ONE route
# over ALL nets -- plane nets INCLUDED. The pour places no taps; the route
# step welds plane pads into the fill and its in-run finalize completes them,
# so do NOT exclude the plane nets here.
python py_router/route_planes.py board.kicad_pcb board.kicad_pcb --nets GND --plane-layers B.Cu
python py_router/route_diff.py board.kicad_pcb -O --nets "*_P" "*_N" --diff-pair-gap 0.15
python py_router/route.py board.kicad_pcb -O --nets "*" --power-nets GND --power-nets-widths 0.3
```

The shared option groups — geometry, power-net widths, algorithm/strategy, proximity penalties, length/time matching, post-route DRC settings, and debug layers — apply across the routing CLIs and are documented in full in [Configuration](docs/configuration.md).

## Requirements

- Python 3.9+ (the router is built `abi3-py39` whether it is downloaded or built
  from source, so building locally does not lower the floor — on 3.8 the module
  compiles and then fails to load with `symbol not found ... _PyCMethod_New`)
- numpy (`pip3 install numpy`)
- scipy (`pip3 install scipy`) - used for optimal target assignment and Voronoi partitioning
- shapely (`pip3 install shapely`) - used for polygon union in multi-net plane layers
- Rust toolchain — only needed if you build the router from source (`python build_router.py --from-source`); not required when using the prebuilt binary

## Limitations

- No push-and-shove (routes around obstacles, doesn't move them)
- No blind or buried vias
- No coarse grid assignment before detailed routing to plan overall topology
- No design rules by region/area support

## Contributing

The most valuable contribution is routing a board we haven't seen: run
`/plan-pcb-routing` on your own design (or any open-hardware board), grade
the result with `check_drc.py` + `check_connected.py`, and file an issue for
anything that breaks — ideally with a pointer to the board file. Fixes and
pull requests for open issues are just as welcome. See
[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the full guide.
