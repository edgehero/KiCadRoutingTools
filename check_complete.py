"""Is this board DONE? The one command that answers it, and fails closed.

        [--intent J] [--impedance-nets G...] [--length-groups J] \
        [--net-min-widths J] [--min-track-width MM] [--min-via-diameter MM] \
        [--clearance MM] [--json PATH]

`board_score` is the authority on `blocking`, and it is honest about being
incomplete -- but read alone it says "done" too easily, three separate ways:

  * IT EXITS 0 WITH FOUR OF NINE COMPONENTS UNGRADED. floorplan, impedance,
    length and net_widths return `skipped(...)` when their flag is absent, and
    `ungraded` does not touch the exit code. A board nobody graded exits 0.
  * `undersized` IS SILENTLY PERMISSIVE without spec numbers. It runs at the
    FAB floor for the layer count, so `undersized == 0` is not "the sizes are
    right" -- one board had 141 of 141 vias violating a 0.6mm spec while
    clearing the 0.25mm two-layer floor.
  * IT HAS NO COMPONENT AT ALL for orphan stubs, weird copper, pad overlaps or
    channel starvation. Several of those are run by the routing chain and none
    of them reaches the scalar.

And underneath all of it, the DRC writeback rewrites the board's own
manufacturing floors down to whatever was produced and then everything grades
against the new value. That is disclosed in a printed line and enforced by
nothing.

So this aggregates, and the difference from board_score is the direction it
fails in. Three verdict classes, and only one of them is "done":

    DONE        every component that could be graded is graded and clean
    INCOMPLETE  a component RAN and could not answer, or an instrument this
                adds found something -- exit 4
    UNSOUND     the board grades clean against floors it rewrote -- exit 5

UNGRADED components do NOT block DONE -- a board with no spec files has nothing
to grade them against, and making that fatal would put every corpus board
permanently in the failing state -- but they are NAMED in the verdict line,
because a component nothing examined is UNEXAMINED and never clean.

Exit: 0 done, 2 usage, 3 board state, 4 incomplete, 5 unsound floors.
