"""Is this pad reachable, or is the router being blamed for the geometry?

    python3 check_reachability.py board.kicad_pcb --pad U3.23
    python3 check_reachability.py board.kicad_pcb --pad U3.23 --track 0.15 --json

Measures the widest track that can reach the rest of the net from that pad, by
Euclidean distance transform plus an exact Kruskal widest path (see
`placement/reachability.py`). Two verdicts, and they mean different things:

    PASSABLE -- a route EXISTS at this track width. If the router failed, that
                is a finding about the ROUTER (grid, ordering, ripup budget),
                not about the board.
    CAGED    -- no route exists at ANY grid. This one IS geometry, and the fix
                is placement or a spec change.

Why it exists: across four recorded runs, 9 of 14 "no placement can fix this"
claims were later refuted, and every claim that a pad was unroutable in
principle was wrong. The rule this tool enforces is simple -- **no impossibility
claim without a numeric field.**

Clearances are read from the BOARD (netclasses via the sibling `.kicad_pro`,
then `--clearance` as the base), so the verdict is graded at what the board
would actually route at rather than at a guessed round number.

Exit codes: 0 PASSABLE, 1 CAGED, 2 usage/geometry error.

**1 is reserved for the geometry verdict and nothing else.** An argument that
names nothing on this board -- a misspelled ref, a pad number that is not there,
an unreadable board file -- exits 2 with what it could not resolve. It used to
exit 1, because `raise SystemExit(msg)` does, and a caller acting on exit 1
re-enters placement and throws away every routed board.

    Its own exception type because the ALTERNATIVE was `raise SystemExit(msg)`,

    verdict, the most expensive answer it can give. Measured:

        --pad NOSUCH.9  -> exit 1   a typo
        --pad RM1.1.1   -> exit 1   a real pad, named "1.1"
        --pad U1.1      -> exit 2   the honest "nothing to reach here"

    The loop's L3 stage treats "a single genuine CAGED on the copper-free board"
    as sufficient to re-enter placement, and re-entering placement discards every
    routed board. So a misspelling could buy the most expensive misclassification
    in the loop, and nearly did. `target_cells == 0` was already guarded against
    a false PASSABLE (:224); this is the same guard on the other side, and the
    false CAGED is the costlier of the two.
