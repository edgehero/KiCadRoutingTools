    a `margin`-radius disc at (x, y) is clear of every FOREIGN copper item on
    `layer` -- i.e. real zone fill can provably exist there.

    The zone credit in check_net_connectivity otherwise trusts the pour
    OUTLINE, which over-credits: a pad inside the outline but in a
    clearance-carved pocket grades 'plane-connected', and a REMOVAL pass
    trusting that grade deletes the pad's genuinely load-bearing tap (the
    bitaxe Q2 shredded-stub opens). Removal gates pass this validator so
    outline credit only applies where fill can actually flow. Conservative
    by construction: a False only DENIES credit, which blocks a removal.

    Foreign geometry is bucketed per layer on first use (1mm cells), so each
    validate() is O(local).

    The buckets are built at a FIXED reach (_BUCKET_REACH_MARGIN, the largest
    margin any caller uses) so validator instances with different margins can
    share them: pass the same `shared_buckets` dict to each (sweep_dead_ends
    builds two validators per net -- credit margin 0.25, anchor margin 0.02 --
    and with margin baked into the reach each one re-bucketed every foreign
    via / segment / pad on the board). A larger-reach bucket is a superset,
    so any query margin <= the build reach stays exact. The dict is scoped to
    the CALLER (never cached on pcb_data): copper mutates between sweeps and
    a stale bucket would over-permit."""
