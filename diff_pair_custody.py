"""Per-pair failure diagnostics + reconciliation casualty custody for
differential-pair routing (Tier-1 lever: diff commits 1+3).

Two engine-side gaps this module closes (inside batch_route_diff_pairs, so the
CLI front and the GUI plugin inherit both for free):

1. DIAGNOSTICS - when a diff pair fails / is deferred, JSON_SUMMARY now carries
   a structured per-pair record saying WHY (reason code + stage + blockers),
   including an explicit 'pose-router-failure' code so PoseRouter search
   exhaustion is never silent again (#346), plus a member audit that verifies
   BOTH members' connectivity claims against actual pad connectivity.

2. CASUALTY CUSTODY - a net ripped during diff routing whose reroute never
   landed used to ship at ZERO copper with no custody. Every committed rip is
   now recorded (net id -> its pre-rip copper); at end of run a casualties-only
   reconciliation (depth 1, no rip authority) runs restore-FIRST semantics:
   verify actually broken, restore the original geometry (collision-aware
   restore_net refuses restores that would short copper routed meanwhile -
   never a blind restore), then re-route the still-broken with the restored
   copper as obstacles; last resort is a piece-level partial restore of the
   non-colliding copper (parity with route.py's #134 last resort).

All imports of routing machinery are lazy (function-level) so this module can
be imported by diff_pair_loop / reroute_loop without cycles.
