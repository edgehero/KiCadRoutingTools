"""What this clone can actually do, as JSON.

A board repository pins a KiCadRoutingTools clone through an environment
variable and then routes with it. Today the strongest check available to that
consumer is "does route.py exist as a file" -- which passes for a clone that is
years old, on the wrong branch, or missing the module the chain depends on. The
run then completes, prints green, and describes an engine the repo does not
pin. That is the one failure a no-fallbacks rule exists to prevent, and nothing
detects it.

So: publish the capability set and let the consumer assert against it.

    python3 krt_capabilities.py                 # everything, as JSON
    python3 krt_capabilities.py --require route.py:--fab-overrides board_score
    python3 route.py --capabilities             # same JSON, from the router

`--require` takes `module` or `module:--flag` tokens and exits non-zero listing
everything missing, so a consumer's check is one line and its failure message
names the gap instead of the symptom.

    Read from the source rather than by importing and building the parser:
    importing runs module-level code, and a consumer asking "can this clone do
    X" must not be able to trigger a side effect by asking.

    Reading only the script's OWN text is not enough, and the failure is the
    dangerous direction -- a false NEGATIVE. Several flags are added by a shared
    helper in another module (`fab_tiers.add_fab_args` registers
    `--fab-tier`/`--fab-overrides` for route.py, route_diff.py, the fanouts and
    the plane scripts), so a text scan of route.py reports `--fab-overrides` as
    unsupported on a clone that supports it perfectly well -- and a consumer that
    trusts `--require` then refuses to run against a good engine. So follow the
    script's LOCAL imports one level and union their flags too.

    One level, and only modules resolving to a .py beside the script: enough for
    a registrar helper, and it cannot wander into the whole dependency graph.

    FOLLOW REGISTRARS, NEVER OTHER CLIs. That distinction is the whole
    correctness of this function, and getting it wrong inverts the tool's
    failure mode into the dangerous direction. `route_planes.py` imports
    `route.py` (and `check_drc.py`, and `list_nets.py`), so an indiscriminate
    hop hands route_planes route.py's entire 97-flag vocabulary -- and
    `--require route_planes.py:--net-clearances` then answers OK for a flag
    argparse rejects with exit 2. A consumer's chain dies mid-run on a
    capability check that passed.

    The discriminator is structural, not a name list: a REGISTRAR adds arguments
    to a parser somebody else owns (`fab_tiers.py`: 2 add_argument, 0
    ArgumentParser); a CLI builds its own (`route.py`: 97 add_argument, 1
    ArgumentParser). Only a module that never constructs an ArgumentParser can
    be contributing its flags to this script's parser.
