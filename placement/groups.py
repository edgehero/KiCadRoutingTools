"""Placement blocks: which footprints should move as one rigid body (#459).

The quench fixes what it can reach — individual parts within a few mm. The
failures that sink a board are block-scale: a magnetics block 80mm from its
endpoints, unroutable because of the floorplan rather than the routing. Before
anything can *move* a block, something has to know what a block IS, and nothing
in this repo did.

Four sources, in precedence order, first match wins per footprint. Each is
reported with its source so a user can see what was inferred before trusting it.

    kicad      KiCad (group ...) blocks -- the designer's own statement that
               these parts belong together, so it outranks everything inferred.
    sheet      Schematic sheet path. A sheet IS the functional block a floorplan
               thinks in, and it is declarative rather than guessed.
    netprefix  Net-name prefix (AUDIO_*, GPDI_*), gated on spatial coherence.
    decap      Two-pad capacitors tethered to the IC they decouple.

CORPUS EVIDENCE (measured across kicad_files/, not assumed):

  kicad      0 of 27 boards carry a single (group ...) block. Exact when present,
             but no in-repo board exercises it end to end.
  sheet      12 of 22 boards with (path ...) have more than one sheet. ulx3s: 11
             sheets sized 83/34/23/20/20/12 footprints. glasgow_revC: 4, nested.
             This is the workhorse.
  decap      Median distance from a 2-pad cap to the nearest IC bbox is 0.0-2.6mm
             across 8 boards, and the cap shares a net with that IC in 93-100% of
             cases (e.g. glasgow 91/92, orangecrab 75/75, ulx3s 57/70). The
             net-sharing check is what makes this safe: it is what separates "a
             cap that decouples this IC" from "a cap that happens to sit nearby",
             and on ulx3s it correctly rejects 13 of 70.
  netprefix  The WEAKEST source, and it is worth saying so. Raw prefixes are
             dominated by KiCad's auto-generated Net-(U1-Pad) names -- 21 to 92
             refs per board under a bogus "NET" prefix, spread over 16-75mm.
             With auto-generated and power names excluded and a 20mm coherence
             gate, what remains is small but genuine: ulx3s 9 blocks / 63 refs
             (AUDIO, GPDI, JTAG, LED, FPGA), orangecrab 13/80, glasgow 3/20,
             rp2350 1 block of 3, tigard 0. Enable it expecting little.

All output is sorted. Anything whose order can reach the optimizer must be
deterministic, or quench output stops being reproducible across processes (#457).
