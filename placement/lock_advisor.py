"""Which parts should NOT be moved? Advice, never action (#431).

The user's ask was "lock components, but only the ones really needed on that
exact location (HAT ports etc)". This reports them with a reason each and prints
a paste-ready `--lock` list. It never locks anything, because a wrong auto-lock
silently freezes a part that needed to move and that failure is invisible --
the run just quietly does less.

## The strongest rule is a code fact, not folklore

`placement/quench.py:207` keeps only `net_id > 0` pads:

    self.pads_local = [(p.local_x, p.local_y, p.net_id)
                       for p in fp.pads if p.net_id > 0]

so a net-less NPTH mounting hole has `pin_count == 0` and `nets == []`. The only
skip in the part loop (`:340`) is `if not fp.pads`, and a mounting hole HAS a
pad. So it is in `state.parts`, it is movable, and **no airwire opposes it** --
only the halo and edge terms decide where it goes. The quench will slide an M3
hole across the board to relieve someone else's halo gradient. Measured:
`tigard.kicad_pcb` has 4 unlocked M3 holes in exactly this state.

## Confidence, and being honest about which signals are weak

Geometric rules measure the board. Lexical rules guess from names, and the
guess is asymmetric: on a stock-KiCad-library board `Connector_USB:USB_C_...`
is near-exact, while a house library (`interf_u:PGA120`) yields nothing. False
negatives are common, false positives rare -- the right shape for advice, and
the output says so.

A ref matched by rules from two DIFFERENT evidence channels (one geometric, one
lexical) promotes to `high`: two channels that fail independently.

    An overhang means two opposite things depending on the answer, and the

    which is how it is soldered, and only its shell hangs past the edge. A part
    that has been DISPLACED sits wholly outside, touching nothing.

    Both report an overhang, so overhang alone cannot tell them apart, and
    treating every overhang as an edge-mount promotes the damage itself to a
    lock recommendation -- which freezes it exactly where it must not stay.

    None when there is no outline to ask.

    A rectangular board has no rings at all -- the gate reports `active=False`
    because its outline IS its bounding box -- and `_point_on_board` answers
    True for every point when handed no outer ring. Asking it alone would make
