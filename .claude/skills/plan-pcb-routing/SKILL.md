# Plan PCB Routing

When this skill is invoked with a KiCad PCB file, perform a comprehensive analysis and present a routing plan to the user.

## Step 1: Load and Analyze PCB Structure

```python
from kicad_parser import parse_kicad_pcb
pcb = parse_kicad_pcb('path/to/file.kicad_pcb')

# Basic stats
print(f'Total nets: {len(pcb.nets)}')
print(f'Total footprints: {len(pcb.footprints)}')
print(f'Existing segments: {len(pcb.segments)}')
print(f'Existing vias: {len(pcb.vias)}')
```

Report to user:
- Number of nets, components, existing routing
- Whether this is a fresh board or partially routed

## Step 2: Identify Copper Layers

Check the KiCad file directly for layer definitions:

```bash
grep -E "^\s+\([0-9]+ \".*\.Cu\"" path/to/file.kicad_pcb
```

Report to user:
- Available copper layers (F.Cu, B.Cu, In1.Cu, In2.Cu, etc.)
- Whether it's a 2-layer, 4-layer, or multi-layer board

### Stackup Check (always run this early)

Inspect the stackup now, before planning, and report the verdict **at the top of the
plan report** so problems surface before any routing work:

```python
from kicad_parser import parse_kicad_pcb
pcb = parse_kicad_pcb('path/to/file.kicad_pcb')
for layer in pcb.board_info.stackup:  # List[StackupLayer], ordered top to bottom
    print(layer.name, layer.layer_type, layer.thickness, layer.epsilon_r)
```

- No stackup section, or all dielectrics with identical thickness and ε_r ≈ 4.5, means
  KiCad's untouched default. If the board also has impedance-relevant signals (see the
  speed detection in Step 4), lead the report with a clear warning: impedance and
  time-matching calculations will not match the user's fab, and `/recommend-stackup`
  should be run before impedance-controlled routing. Take plane-layer assignments from
  its output when available.
- A 2-layer board with multiple differential pairs or planes-worth of power nets is
  itself worth flagging (no inner layers for reference planes).
- If the stackup looks deliberate, say so in one line and move on.

Report problems prominently but still produce the full plan - the user decides whether
to fix the stackup first.

## Step 3: Check for Components Needing Fanout

Identify BGA, QFN, QFP, PGA, LGA, and other array packages that benefit from escape routing:

```python
for ref, fp in pcb.footprints.items():
    name_upper = fp.footprint_name.upper()
    pad_count = len(fp.pads)

    # Check for array / fine-pitch land/no-lead packages by name. Note 'QFP'
    # already matches LQFP/TQFP/VQFP, 'QFN' matches VQFN/WQFN/HVQFN, and 'BGA'
    # matches FBGA/UFBGA/TFBGA, so only distinct families need listing.
    needs_fanout = any(k in name_upper for k in (
        'BGA',          # ball grid array
        'PGA',          # pin grid array (through-hole)
        'LGA',          # land grid array (interior lands, e.g. LGA-12) - issue #144
        'CSP', 'WLCSP', 'WLP',  # wafer-level / chip-scale = micro-BGA, sub-0.5mm
        'CGA',          # column grid array
        'QFN', 'DFN',   # quad / dual no-lead (exposed-pad)
        'QFP',          # quad flat pack
    ))

    # Fine-pitch arrays strand even at low pad count: trigger by PITCH + interior
    # pads, not just pad_count > 40 (issue #144: LGA-12 at 0.5mm has only 12 pads
    # but its center lands box in). Compute the min pad-to-pad spacing and whether
    # any pad is interior (not on the bounding-box edge).
    if not needs_fanout and pad_count >= 6:
        xs = sorted({round(p.local_x, 3) for p in fp.pads})
        ys = sorted({round(p.local_y, 3) for p in fp.pads})
        def _min_step(v):
            return min((b - a for a, b in zip(v, v[1:])), default=999)
        pitch = min(_min_step(xs), _min_step(ys))
        minx, maxx, miny, maxy = xs[0], xs[-1], ys[0], ys[-1]
        has_interior = any(minx < round(p.local_x, 3) < maxx and
                           miny < round(p.local_y, 3) < maxy for p in fp.pads)
        # Fine pitch (<=0.6mm) with interior pads, OR a large multi-row part.
        if (pitch <= 0.6 and has_interior) or pad_count > 40:
            needs_fanout = True

    if needs_fanout:
        # Analyze pad arrangement
        xs = sorted(set(round(p.local_x, 2) for p in fp.pads))
        ys = sorted(set(round(p.local_y, 2) for p in fp.pads))
        grid_cols, grid_rows = len(xs), len(ys)

        # Check SMD vs through-hole
        smd_count = sum(1 for p in fp.pads if p.drill == 0)
        th_count = sum(1 for p in fp.pads if p.drill > 0)
```

### Fanout Tool Selection

| Package Type | Tool | Notes |
|--------------|------|-------|
| BGA (SMD grid) | `bga_fanout.py` | Escape routing for ball grid arrays |
| PGA (through-hole grid) | `bga_fanout.py` | Same tool works for PGA |
| LGA / WLCSP / CGA (land/chip-scale grid) | `bga_fanout.py` | Grid escape; interior lands strand without it (issue #144) |
| QFN/QFP/DFN (perimeter SMD) | `qfn_fanout.py` | Stub routing for quad/dual no-lead and flat packages |
| **AQFN / staggered multi-row no-lead** | `qfn_fanout.py` **`--escape-method underpad --allow-via-in-pad`** | Inner rows the surface fan cannot reach - see below. **Never `bga_fanout.py`** |
| DIP/SOIC (through-hole/SMD rows) | None needed | Standard routing handles these |

### When to Use Fanout for BGA/PGA/LGA

**Rule: Use fanout for any grid array (BGA/PGA/LGA/WLCSP/CGA) with more than 2 pins
depth from outside to center, OR any fine-pitch (<=0.5mm) array with interior pads
regardless of pin count** — a small LGA-12/WLCSP at 0.5mm pitch boxes its center
lands in even though it has well under 40 pads (issue #144).

**Important:** Calculate ACTUAL depth by counting pads from the edge toward center, not grid size.
Many PGA/BGA packages (especially FPGAs/CPLDs) have hollow centers with only perimeter pins populated.

To calculate actual depth:
```python
# Check middle column from top edge toward center
mid_col = xs[len(xs)//2]
depth = 0
for y in ys:  # ys sorted from edge
    if (mid_col, y) in pad_positions:
        depth += 1
    else:
        break  # Stop at first empty position
```

Examples:
- 13×13 grid, fully populated → depth = 7 → **USE FANOUT**
- 13×13 grid, hollow center (3 rows populated) → depth = 3 → **USE FANOUT**
- 10×10 grid, hollow center (2 rows populated) → depth = 2 → fanout optional
- 4×4 grid, fully populated → depth = 2 → fanout optional

Inner pins beyond depth 2 cannot escape without fanout routing through channels between outer pins.

**Escape layers (multi-layer boards):** `bga_fanout.py` defaults to `--layers F.Cu B.Cu`
only. On a 4+ layer board, pass ALL the board's copper layers, e.g.
`--layers F.Cu In1.Cu In2.Cu B.Cu` — otherwise deep balls have nowhere to escape to
and those nets are dropped from the fanout. `qfn_fanout.py` is perimeter-only and
doesn't take escape layers.

**Staggered multi-row no-lead packages (AQFN) - use via-in-pad (#500).** An
AQFN (e.g. `Nordic_AQFN-73-1EP_7x7mm_P0.5mm`, on osprey_kb / hex_gateway /
mikoto_nrf52840) puts its pads in TWO OR MORE staggered rows per side. The
surface 45-degree stub fan reaches only the outermost row, so the default
silently drops the rest. Measured on osprey_kb U1 (78 pads, 39 nets):

| command | escaped | time |
|---|---|---|
| `qfn_fanout.py` (default stub) | 26/40 | 2.4s |
| `qfn_fanout.py --escape-method underpad` | 35/40 | 2.6s |
| **`qfn_fanout.py --escape-method underpad --allow-via-in-pad`** | **39/39, DRC-clean** | **2.4s** |
| `bga_fanout.py` | 39/39 | **2967s** |

So: **for any AQFN or staggered multi-row no-lead part, plan
`qfn_fanout.py --escape-method underpad --allow-via-in-pad`.** Via-in-pad is
what reaches the innermost row; without it 5 pads drop.

Do NOT send these to `bga_fanout.py`. It models a ball grid, and a staggered
package's two offset rows project onto each axis at HALF the real pad spacing -
so its detected pitch is half the truth, its escape budget evaluates to a
NEGATIVE via size, and it grinds for ~50 minutes to reach the same answer.
`bga_fanout.py` now refuses these outright with the qfn_fanout command to use
(override: `KICAD_ALLOW_STAGGERED_BGA=1`).

Spotting one: the footprint name contains `AQFN`, or the part has far more pads
than a single peripheral ring of its size would hold (73-90 pads on a 7x7mm
body), or `bga_fanout.py` reports a pitch that is half the name's `P<pitch>mm`.

**Crowded fine-pitch QFN edge (surface fan has no room):** if a `qfn_fanout`
stub (especially a diff pair) is boxed in by a neighbour pair and a foreign
track and the surface 45° fan drops it, use `qfn_fanout.py --escape-method
underpad --via-size 0.45 --via-drill 0.25` (#164). It drops a through-via just
past each pad and escapes on an inner/back layer — straight out past the lateral
congestion instead of fanning into it (adjacent vias are staggered to clear).
Match `--via-size`/`--via-drill` to the board's fine-pitch via rule. If the
underpad run still **drops** a leg ("N dropped") because the via has no clear
room *outward* (a neighbour pad/track exactly one pitch away), add
`--allow-via-in-pad` (#161): the escape via may then sit on its own pad and
stagger *inward toward the chip*, away from the neighbour, instead of being
dropped. It still clears every other-net pad/via/track — it only gains
permission to overlap its own pad — so reach for it specifically when underpad
reports drops on a boxed-in fine-pitch pair.

**Size the escape via/track to the pitch BEFORE running fanout (issue #158).**
`bga_fanout.py` escapes one track down the channel between adjacent via columns —
at the **half-pitch**. So the via, track, and clearance must fit that half-pitch
or *every* escape grazes the neighbouring column's via by a few µm, and the fanout
still reports `failed: 0` (its success metric ignores sub-clearance grazes). The
budget, per array (measure each component's own pitch — they differ):

```
via_size + track_width + 2·clearance + margin ≤ pitch     (one escape track per channel)
via_size ≥ via_drill + 2·min_annular_ring,  track_width ≥ fab min track   (fab floors)
```

Don't just shrink the via against a *fixed* track — **solve for via AND track
together**, taking each down toward the fab floor as the pitch demands, and leave
a little margin so the result clears DRC instead of merely touching it. Read each
array's own ball pitch `P` (the min ball spacing — arrays on one board differ) and
the requested clearance `C` (Default net-class clearance from
`list_nets.py --design-rules`), plus the board's fab floors (`min_track_width`,
`min_via_diameter`/`min_via_drill`, annular ring), then:

```python
margin = 0.05                                  # slack: clear DRC, don't graze it
budget = P - 2*C - margin                       # room for one via + one track
track  = max(min(nominal_track, 0.15), min_track_width)   # keep a routable track
via    = min(nominal_via, budget - track)       # largest via that still fits
if via < via_floor:                # via fell below the floor -> thin the track to free room
    via   = via_floor
    track = max(min_track_width, budget - via)
infeasible = track < min_track_width or via < via_floor   # even fab floors won't fit
via_drill  = max(min_via_drill, via - 2*min_annular_ring)  # hold the annular ring at floor
# via_floor = max(min_via_diameter, min_via_drill + 2*min_annular_ring)
```

Pass the computed `--via-size via --via-drill via_drill --track-width track
--clearance C` to the fanout step. If `infeasible`, the pitch can't take a channel
escape even at the fab floor → switch to `--escape-method underpad` and/or add
escape layers; don't ship the graze.

**Plan params can set ANY GUI option:** in the GUI's RESULT schema, each
step's `params` may include any option shown on that step's tab or the shared
options panel, keyed by its snake_case field name (`max_iterations`,
`max_ripup`, `grid_step`, `board_edge_clearance`, `hole_to_hole_clearance`,
`via_cost`, `heuristic_weight`, `turn_cost`, `ordering_strategy`, ...).
Unknown names are ignored with a note in the plan log. Use this to carry the
same values the equivalent CLI chain would pass (e.g. `--max-iterations
1000000 --max-ripup 10 --grid-step 0.05`), so a GUI plan run matches a stress
run step for step.

**Why this heuristic matters for the GUI:** the plugin runs `/plan-pcb-routing` in
*plan-only* mode — it never executes the fanout and never runs the DRC↔smaller-via
retry loop, so it cannot discover a too-big via after the fact and shrink it. The
plan must therefore carry via/track that are **already** DRC-safe for the pitch.
Computing them here — both dimensions, with margin, clamped to the fab floor — is
what lets the single fanout the GUI runs come out clean the first time.

Worked example (keks U1, pitch 0.8, clearance 0.1, fab floor track 0.1 / via 0.45):
`budget = 0.8 − 0.2 − 0.05 = 0.55`; track 0.127 → via = min(working, 0.55−0.127) =
**0.42** (≥ floor) → DRC-clean, vs the Ø0.5 the net-class default would have used
(163 grazes). At 0.4 mm pitch the budget forces both to the floor (track 0.10, via
~0.30/0.20 advanced); if even those don't fit, go `--escape-method underpad`.
`bga_fanout.py` also warns `WARNING: escape via ... busts the half-pitch budget`
when handed infeasible params, but choose feasible ones here so it never fires.

**Always check the fanout escaped all requested balls.** `bga_fanout.py` ends with
`JSON_SUMMARY: {"component", "requested", "escaped", "failed", "unescaped_nets", ...}`.
A dropped ball is **removed from the output** and later fails signal routing as "no
rippable blockers", so it must be caught here. If `failed > 0`, retry the fanout with
more layers and/or a smaller `--clearance` (see "Escape clearance" below) before
moving on — do not start signal routing while balls are still dropped.

**If balls still drop on a dense, fully-populated array, switch to the under-pad
escape:** add `--escape-method underpad` with a small via/track for the pitch
(e.g. `--via-size 0.35 --track-width 0.12 --clearance 0.1` at 0.8 mm pitch). The
default `channel` engine confines every layer to the gaps *between* ball rows, so
a few channels over-subscribe and the deepest balls can't escape; `underpad`
routes each ball *under* the pad field on inner layers via a via-in-pad and
escapes arrays `channel` can't (e.g. a 22×22 BGA that drops ~20 balls → 0).
Caveats: it routes diff pairs as **single-ended**, and it **skips power/plane
nets** (they tap their plane), so create the planes first (or exclude power with
`--nets`). Rule of thumb: try `channel` first (keeps diff pairs); fall back to
`underpad` when `channel` can't escape a dense array.

**After every BGA/PGA fanout, run the decoupling-cap placement optimizer
(#130).** A fanout drops vias near the ball field; where a foreign-net via
lands under a decoupling cap placed at a ball, the via copper overlaps the
cap pad → a real `PAD-VIA` DRC violation at the clearance floor. The fix is
placement, so run `place_fanout_clearance.py` on the **fanned** board to
nudge those caps clear (and pull each pad toward its nearest same-net ball so
a power/GND via dropped there later shares the via). See "Step 1b" below for
the command. It's cheap, only touches caps near a BGA, and is a no-op when
nothing collides — so run it after each fanout step before moving on.

Report to user:
- List of components that may need fanout
- Package type, pad count, and grid depth for each
- Recommended fanout tool

## Step 4: Check for Differential Pairs and Power Nets

Use `list_nets.py` to detect differential pairs and power/ground nets:

```bash
python3 list_nets.py path/to/file.kicad_pcb --diff-pairs --power
```

### Read the board's design rules and pass them to the CLI

The router does NOT read the board's design rules — it falls back to a generic
`--clearance 0.25` / `--track-width` default, which is often WIDER than the
board's own rule and can box pads in so nets fail with "no rippable blockers".
Read the board's real rules and pass them explicitly:

```bash
python3 list_nets.py path/to/file.kicad_pcb --design-rules
```

**KiCad has TWO tiers of rules, and DRC only enforces one of them — this matters
for fine-pitch boards (#111/#115):**

- **Net-class values** (`clearance`, `track_width`, `via_diameter`, `via_drill`):
  these are the size new objects are *drawn at*. Of these, only **clearance** is
  a DRC-enforced minimum. `track_width` and `via_diameter`/`drill` are **not** DRC
  floors — they are just defaults, so a board can (and the human originals do) use
  a **smaller** via/track than the net-class nominal and still pass DRC.
- **Board Constraints** (`min_clearance`, `min_track_width`, `min_via_diameter`,
  `min_hole_to_hole`, `min_through_hole_diameter`): **these are the actual DRC
  floors.** `--design-rules` reads them from `design_settings.rules` and combines
  them with the JLCPCB fab minimum (backstop when a Constraint is 0/unset — e.g.
  `min_clearance` is frequently 0) into a single **manufacturing floor**.

Use the printed flags as-is:

- **Routing** (`route.py`, `qfn_fanout.py`, `bga_fanout.py`, `route_planes.py`):
  `--clearance` from the **Default class**, but **`--via-size`/`--via-drill`
  from the working floor**, NOT the net-class `via_diameter`. Emitting the net-class
  via everywhere is #115 — it's a max-like default, far too big for fine-pitch
  escape (e.g. a 0.4 mm QFN/BGA needs the small working via the original used).
  For `--track-width`, the net-class value is only a starting point and is *not* a
  hard minimum: on dense/congested boards route ordinary signals at the **fab
  physical floor** instead (thinner is both more complete and faster — see "Route
  signals at the FAB floor by default" in Diagnose and Retry). Keep the net-class
  width only for **current-carrying nets** (`--power-nets`).
  **Do NOT keep the net-class gap/width for impedance-controlled (diff-pair) nets** —
  the stock net class is usually wide (`diff_pair_gap` 0.25 / width 0.2 mm), and a
  fat pair is a wider bundle that gets dropped on congested boards (measured:
  `glasgow_revC` routes all 13 FPGA pairs at `--diff-pair-gap 0.1` but loses 2 at
  0.25). Per `/find-high-speed-nets`, route those at the **fab floor for gap and
  clearance (~0.1 mm)** while keeping `--impedance` for the width (the router
  computes it from the stackup and clamps it to the floor). `route_diff.py` then
  auto-updates the Default net class to those tight values (only-loosen, via
  `fix_kicad_drc_settings.py`), so the `.kicad_pro` stops advertising the wide gap.
- **Diff-pair sizing default + shrink-to-succeed.** Default `route_diff.py` to
  **`--track-width 0.1` and `--diff-pair-gap 0.1`** (the fab floor) — a thin, tight
  bundle routes on congested boards where a fat pair is dropped. If the interface
  is impedance-controlled, ALSO pass `--impedance <ohms>`: the router derives the
  width from the stackup and clamps it to the floor, so the target impedance is
  **maintained** while the geometry stays as small as it can. **When a pair fails
  or falls back** — `route_diff.py`'s `JSON_SUMMARY` lists it in `failed_diff_pairs`
  or `single_ended_diff_pairs`, or DRC shows an intra-pair / via-via graze — re-run
  the failing pairs with **smaller track width, smaller gap, AND smaller vias**
  (`--via-size`/`--via-drill` toward the fab via floor). A tighter track+gap fits a
  narrower channel, and smaller vias fit a tight pad pitch (measured: lumenpnp
  USB_D's two 0.5 mm vias collide by 0.1 mm at the connector pitch — a smaller via
  clears it). Step **toward, never below**, the fab floors, and keep `--impedance`
  so the ohms target is held as the geometry shrinks.
- **Escape clearance — trigger on dropped balls, not pitch (issue #122):** the
  inter-ball channel is too narrow to fit a track at the net-class clearance on
  more BGAs than just "fine-pitch" ones. Even an **0.8 mm-pitch** BGA drops balls
  at `--clearance 0.2` (the ~0.45 mm gap between 0.35 mm balls can't fit a 0.2 mm
  track at 0.2 mm clearance) — the same board escapes **all** balls at the 0.1 mm
  floor. So don't gate on pitch: gate on whether balls actually dropped.
  `bga_fanout.py` and `qfn_fanout.py` both end with a `JSON_SUMMARY: {...}` line
  giving `requested`/`escaped`/`failed`/`unescaped_nets`. **After every fanout, parse it;
  if `failed > 0` (escaped < requested), re-run the fanout with `--clearance` at
  the manufacturing floor** (never below it — the floor is the rule the human
  board passes DRC against, so tightening board-wide is manufacturable and needs
  no rule-area settings). If still short, also try the smaller **fine-pitch escape
  via** (below) and/or a narrower `--track-width` toward the floor. Do not proceed
  to signal routing with `failed > 0` unexpected — those balls are dropped from the
  output and will fail later as "no rippable blockers".
- **Also check `drc_grazes` (even when `failed == 0`).** The summary's
  `drc_grazes` (graded at the fanout `--clearance`) reports sub-clearance grazes the
  escape left in the output: `via_segment` / `pad_via` are the #130 classes (an
  escape via too close to a foreign track or pad), `segment_segment` is the #179
  class (two escape **stubs** grazing — typically the 45° fans of two adjacent pads
  of a tight-pitch diff pair, e.g. 0.4 mm-pitch QFN, clipping at the wrist),
  `total` is all DRC violations. A *successful* fanout (every ball/pad escaped) can
  still leave many of these — they're not caught by `failed`. **If any
  `drc_grazes` class > 0 and there is headroom above the fab floor, re-run the
  fanout stepping toward — never below — the floor:**
  - `via_segment` / `pad_via` (#130): smaller **`--via-size` / `--via-drill`**
    (and/or a thinner `--track-width`).
  - `segment_segment` (#179): thinner **`--width`** — the escape stubs carry the
    track width, so narrowing them widens the gap between the two converging
    diagonals. Step down toward the fab-floor track (e.g. 0.15 → 0.13 → 0.10 mm)
    until `segment_segment == 0`; all pads still escape (`failed` stays 0).
    (Measured on hackrf_one U17: 3 grazes at `--width 0.15`/`0.13`, 0 at `0.10`.)

  These grazes are typically a uniform ~1-grid-cell shortfall, so even one size step
  down usually clears them all; shrinking the via also relieves escape congestion.
  (For *via-over-pad* grazes where a decoupling cap/resistor sits on a via,
  `place_fanout_clearance.py` (Step 1b) is the better fix — it moves the part;
  smaller vias/thinner tracks help the via-over-track and stub-over-stub classes.)
- **Fine-pitch escape VIA (4+ layer):** the 0.45 mm standard via can't dog-bone /
  via-in-pad sub-~0.5 mm-pitch BGA/QFN balls. For *those parts only*, pass the
  smaller **fine-pitch escape via** that `--design-rules` prints (`fine-pitch
  escape via <d>/<drill>`, e.g. `0.30/0.15` — JLC "advanced", small extra cost)
  as `--via-size`/`--via-drill` to that part's `bga_fanout.py` / `qfn_fanout.py`,
  to `route_diff.py` when it launches from that part's escaped stubs, **and to
  `route_disconnected_planes.py`** (its per-pad repair connects the fine-pitch
  GND/power plane balls under such parts). Keep the **standard** working via for
  general `route.py` routing and the bulk `route_planes.py` pour — the advanced
  via is escape-only, not a board-wide default (issues #99/#122).
- **Non-Default classes:** route those nets separately with that class's
  `--clearance`/`--track-width` (clearance is the one per-class DRC value, so keep
  each class's nets at their own clearance rather than forcing one global value).
- **Diff pairs:** default `--track-width 0.1 --diff-pair-gap 0.1` for `route_diff.py`
  (NOT the wide net-class values), plus `--impedance` when the interface is
  impedance-controlled; shrink track/gap/via further toward the fab floor for any
  pair that fails or grazes (see "Diff-pair sizing default + shrink-to-succeed").
  **Never set `--diff-pair-gap` below the same command's `--clearance`** — KiCad
  grades the pair's P↔N coupling as a plain clearance violation, so `route_diff`
  floors the gap up to clearance (#441). Set the two equal (both at the fab floor).

**Verification (DRC/connectivity) grades at the manufacturing floor**, not the
inflated net-class clearance — that is the same rule the human original passes, so
it's the honest delta. The routing/plane/fanout steps now **record the smallest
clearance any step actually used** (route_planes/route_disconnected_planes and the
single-ended multipoint taps auto-step the fine-pitch tap clearance DOWN toward the
fab floor as the geometry demands) into the output `.kicad_pro` DRC floor and into
`JSON_SUMMARY` (`min_clearance_used`). `check_drc.py` **auto-grades at that
`.kicad_pro` clearance when `-c` is omitted**, so a bare `check_drc.py board.kicad_pcb`
already grades at the true routed floor. Passing `--clearance <floor>` still works
as an explicit override; see Step 6.

Only fall back to tool defaults when neither net classes nor Constraints are found
(`--design-rules` then prints the JLCPCB fab floor for the board's layer count).

This will output:
- Differential pairs detected (P/N naming conventions)
- Ground nets with pad counts
- Power nets with pad counts

If differential pairs are found:
- List each P/N pair
- Note that `route_diff.py` should be used for these
- Explain that diff pairs maintain consistent spacing and length matching
- **If a pair's pads are on a BGA/PGA being fanned out, escape it with
  `bga_fanout.py` too** — pass `--diff-pairs "<patterns>" --diff-pair-gap <gap>`
  so P and N escape the array together on one layer. Don't just exclude the
  pair from fanout and hand it to `route_diff.py`: it can't launch from the
  deep balls ("no valid position at any setback"). `route_diff.py` then
  connects the escaped stubs — **but on a 4+ layer board you must pass those
  inner layers to `route_diff.py` via `--layers` too** (it defaults to F.Cu
  B.Cu, so an inner-layer escaped stub is otherwise unreachable and the pair is
  silently dropped — issue #116). Pairs not on an array package don't need fanout.

> **Tip:** Name-based detection misses pairs with unconventional names. For boards with
> high-speed ICs (PHYs, SerDes, USB, FPGA transceivers), or when detection finds suspiciously
> few pairs, run `/identify-diff-pairs` for datasheet-based detection by pin function and
> per-interface gap/impedance recommendations.

**Polarity-swap policy (#279).** `route_diff.py` can resolve a P/N polarity mismatch by
swapping the target pads' net assignments — but a swap physically cross-connects one
device's P pin to the other's N pin, and is only harmless when an endpoint can compensate.
Swaps are **denied by default**; grant them per pair with `--polarity-swap-nets <patterns>`.
Before emitting the route_diff command, classify each pair's electrical endpoints (walk
through series AC caps/resistors to the real device):

- **Allow** pairs with an FPGA/CPLD generic-I/O endpoint (pin functions are reassigned in
  gateware — look for paired `IO_LxxP/N`-style pinfunctions on Xilinx/Lattice/Altera/Gowin
  parts), and protocol-tolerant links (PCIe lanes, SerDes with polarity-invert, 1000BASE-T).
- **Deny** USB `D+/D-`, MIPI, TMDS/HDMI/DP, CAN, RS-485/422, DDR `CK/DQS`, clock/analog
  inputs to fixed-function parts, anything reaching a connector or unknown part, and any
  pair whose nets carry an asymmetric attachment (e.g. a single-sided pull-up) — it stays
  on its net and would land on the wrong physical wire. MCUs/SoCs do NOT count as
  programmable (their diff functions are fixed silicon). **When in doubt, deny** — a
  skipped pair beats a dead interface. `/identify-diff-pairs` reports a per-pair
  `polarity_swappable` verdict from datasheet pin functions for the ambiguous cases.

Pass the resulting allowlist, e.g. `--polarity-swap-nets '/fpga/IO_*'` (use `'*'` only when
every pair classifies swappable). Applied swaps are listed in `polarity_swapped_pairs` —
when they happen, the schematic sync step below applies (see "Schematic Synchronization
After Swaps"). Pairs that *wanted* a swap but were denied are listed in
`polarity_swap_denied_pairs` — surface these to the user (they either routed via the
opposite-side flip or failed honestly and may need a manual pin swap in the schematic).

**Far-apart terminal pads → single-ended follow-up (issue #121).** A "diff pair"
sometimes has pads that aren't a coupled connection — e.g. a P and an N test point
several mm apart, or a logical pair daisy-chained through spread-out parts. If the
coupled chain can't be routed, `route_diff.py` peels those far-apart pads off the
chain (routing the genuinely-coupled terminals as a pair) and lists the affected
nets under `single_ended_followup_nets` in its `JSON_SUMMARY` (and a "route them
single-ended next" block on stdout). Those pads are **not** dropped — the **Signal
Routing** step (`route.py "*" "!GND" "!VCC"`) connects them P→P / N→N along with
every other unrouted net, since they remain unrouted after the diff-pair step. So:
**do not exclude the diff-pair nets from the signal-routing step's net selection** —
that step is what finishes the peeled pads. If you scope the signal step to specific
nets instead of `"*"`, add any `single_ended_followup_nets` to it explicitly.

### Check for DDR/High-Speed Memory Signals

Look for DDR signal patterns in the net list that may need length matching:
- Data signals: DQ0-DQ63
- Strobes: DQS, DQM, DM
- Clocks: CLK, CK

If DDR signals detected:
- Note that `--length-match-group auto` should be used
- DQ0-7 + DQS0 form byte lane 0, DQ8-15 + DQS1 form byte lane 1, etc.

Report to user:
- List of detected differential pairs (or "none found")
- Whether `route_diff.py` is needed
- Whether DDR/length-matching is needed

### High-Speed Signal Check (delegate to /find-high-speed-nets)

Whether the plan includes GND return vias - and the `--gnd-via-distance` to use -
is the `/find-high-speed-nets` skill's job: it classifies nets into speed tiers
(datasheet lookup, rise-time estimates) and maps tiers to recommended distances.
Follow that skill's methodology here (its quick net-name/footprint scan decides
whether the deeper datasheet pass is worth it) and put the recommended distance
into the plan's GND-via step. Remember its physical floor: never set
`--gnd-via-distance` below 3 x (via_size + clearance), ~2.5 mm for standard vias.

Report to user when presenting the plan:
- If high-speed nets found: "**GND Return Vias:** This board has [tier] signals ([examples]).
  GND return vias are included in Step N with `--gnd-via-distance [X]mm`. Let me know if
  you'd like to skip this step."
- If no high-speed nets found: "**GND Return Vias:** No high-speed signals detected (only
  low-frequency I2C/UART/GPIO). GND return vias are included in the plan but are optional
  for this board. Want me to remove the step?"

`/find-high-speed-nets` ALSO reports **controlled-impedance nets** (its Step 4.5):
RF/antenna feeds (radio/PA/LNA -> SMA/U.FL/chip-antenna = **50 ohm single-ended**,
or 100 ohm if balanced), DDR SSTL, and the impedance-controlled diff interfaces.
Thread these into the plan:

- **Differential** impedance nets stay in the diff-pair step (Step 2) — just add
  `route_diff.py --impedance <ohms>`.
- **Single-ended** impedance nets (RF 50, DDR SSTL 40) get a **dedicated
  `route.py --impedance` pass placed AFTER diff pairs and BEFORE the general
  signal route** (Step 2b below). They must then be **excluded from the general
  signal route** (`"*" "!GND" "!VCC" "!RF"`) and counted in the Step 5b ledger as
  claimed by the impedance step — otherwise a later rip-up re-routes them at the
  wrong width.
- Impedance width is computed from the **stackup**: if the board has only KiCad's
  default stackup, lead the report with that warning and run `/recommend-stackup`
  first (an RF feed routed at a wrong width is electrically useless).
- For an RF/antenna feed also recommend (in words) a `User.2` keepout around the
  antenna region and `--keepout`, and route it short/direct on an outer layer.

If no controlled-impedance nets are found, omit Step 2b.

### Step 2b-i: Coplanar (CPW-over-ground) — decide this WITH the plane step (#486)

An impedance trace on an **outer layer that will also carry a GND pour** is not a
microstrip: the side ground pulls Z0 down hard, so hitting the target needs a
**narrower** trace (e.g. 0.277 mm instead of 0.376 mm for 50 Ω on 0.2 mm FR4).
Routing the microstrip width through a pour lands the trace well below target.

The router cannot detect this — at route time the pour does not exist yet. So
this is **your decision to make in the plan**, and it must be coordinated across
two steps that run at different times.

**Declare coplanar when ALL of these hold:**
1. The impedance net routes on an **outer layer** (`F.Cu` / `B.Cu`). Inner layers
   are stripline; the flag is ignored there.
2. A `route_planes` step in this plan pours **GND on that same layer** — or the
   board already has an outer-layer GND pour that will survive.
3. You can name the gap: it is the pour's zone clearance.

**If you are not pouring on the signal's own layer, do NOT pass `--coplanar-gap`.**
A coplanar declaration whose pour never arrives leaves the trace too narrow, i.e.
impedance too HIGH — the opposite error, equally wrong.

**Coordination — one number, three places:**

```bash
# choose ONE gap G (the pour's clearance; near the fab floor, e.g. 0.2)
# 1. route the impedance nets, declaring G
python3 route.py in.kicad_pcb s2b.kicad_pcb --nets "RF*" \
    --impedance 50 --coplanar-gap 0.2 --clearance 0.2

# 2. pour GND on the SAME layer with a MATCHING zone clearance
python3 route_planes.py s2b.kicad_pcb s5.kicad_pcb \
    --nets GND GND --plane-layers F.Cu B.Cu --zone-clearance 0.2

# 3. verify the declaration actually held
python3 check_impedance.py s5.kicad_pcb --coplanar-gap 0.2 --nets "RF*"
```

- `--coplanar-nets "<patterns>"` narrows the declaration to some nets in a call;
  omit it and every net in that call is treated as coplanar. Since Step 2b is
  already a dedicated impedance pass over exactly those nets, omitting it is
  usually right.
- `route_diff.py` takes `--coplanar-gap` but has **no** `--coplanar-nets` (the
  diff engine bakes one width per layer). Split interfaces into separate calls.
- The gap must be **achievable**: it is a pour clearance, so it cannot be below
  the fab floor, and near via antipads / pads the real gap will be wider. The
  Step-3 audit reports how much of each net actually achieved it.

**Report to the user** which nets you declared coplanar, the gap, and the plane
step it is tied to — this is a coupled choice they may want to override. If the
board has no outer-layer pour planned, say so explicitly and note that the
impedance nets are being routed as plain microstrip.

## Step 5: Review Power and Ground Net Strategy (delegate to /recommend-plane-mappings)

Which nets deserve planes and on which copper layers is the
`/recommend-plane-mappings` skill's job: it weighs pad counts and datasheet
current estimates, and assigns layers with SI rationale (GND adjacent to signal
layers for return paths, power planes paired against GND, split layers for
multiple rails). Follow its methodology here, seeded by the `list_nets.py --power`
output, and put the resulting net -> layer assignments into the plan's
`route_planes` steps. Nets it leaves to wide traces become `--power-nets` /
`--power-nets-widths` on the route step instead.

Report to user:
- Identified GND nets and pad counts
- Identified power nets and pad counts
- Recommended strategy (plane vs wide traces) with layer assignments

## Step 5b: Net-Coverage Reconciliation (mandatory — do not skip)

The stages partition every routable net by glob pattern, and the patterns are
**not** reconciled automatically. The failure mode this step prevents: a net is
*excluded* from one stage (`!X`) but never *claimed* by a later one, so it
silently gets zero copper and the run "completes" with it fully unrouted. This
is exactly how `GNDA` (an analog ground tied to `GND` through a single 0Ω/
ferrite) was dropped — excluded from the signal route as a "power net", yet never
added to the plane step's `--nets`, ending with 0/23 pads connected while the run
reported success.

**The invariant: every routable net (≥2 pads, not no-connect) must be claimed by
exactly one stage. A net excluded from any stage MUST be claimed by a later one.**

Before running any command, write the net-handling ledger and reconcile it
mechanically — do not eyeball it:

1. **Assign every routable net to one handler:**
   - `fanout + signal route` — ordinary signals (the `"*"` selection minus exclusions)
   - `diff-pair route` — detected pairs
   - `impedance SE route (Step 2b)` — single-ended controlled-impedance nets (RF/antenna
     50 ohm, DDR SSTL 40 ohm); excluded from the signal route, NOT poured
   - `plane / pour` — every net you exclude from the signal route with `!X` that a plane pours
   - `wide trace` — power carried *inside* the route selection via `--power-nets` (NOT excluded)

2. **Diff the pattern lists.** The set of signal-route exclusions (`!A !B …`) MUST
   equal the nets the plane step pours PLUS the single-ended impedance nets routed
   in Step 2b. A net in the symmetric difference is a plan bug — excluded from
   routing but handled by no later stage (→ unrouted), or poured/impedance-routed
   but not excluded (→ also routed as ordinary tracks, defeating it). Print and
   assert the difference is empty:
   ```python
   route_exclusions = {"GND", "+3V3", "RF"}     # the !X you will pass route.py
   plane_nets       = {"GND", "+3V3"}           # the --nets you pass route_planes.py
   impedance_se     = {"RF"}                     # nets routed in Step 2b (route.py --impedance)
   orphans = route_exclusions ^ (plane_nets | impedance_se)   # symmetric difference
   assert not orphans, f"Net-coverage gap: {sorted(orphans)} handled by no stage"
   ```
   Do not proceed until `orphans` is empty.

3. **Secondary grounds / split rails** (`AGND`, `GNDA`, `DGND`, `VREF`, or any rail
   tied to its parent through a single 0Ω resistor or ferrite bead — find the tie
   with `list_nets.py`: the part with one pad on each net). These are real,
   separate nets. Pour each as **its own local region** (Voronoi-sharing an inner
   layer with the main ground is fine) and let the single tie component join it to
   the parent. **Never** merge it into the parent plane (that shorts the split and
   defeats its purpose — a green connectivity check then hides an electrical error)
   and **never** leave it out (that leaves it unrouted). Give each its own `--nets`
   entry in the plane step, so it appears in BOTH lists in step 2 above.

## Step 6: Generate Routing Plan

Based on the analysis, generate a step-by-step plan. The general order is:

### Routing Order Rationale

1. **Fanout** (if needed) - Escape routing first, while the board is empty. Exclude
   nets that planes will handle (`"*" "!GND" "!VCC"`). **After each BGA/PGA
   fanout, run `place_fanout_clearance.py`** (Step 1b) to clear decoupling-cap /
   fanout-via collisions (#130) before signal routing.
2. **Differential Pairs** - The most constrained routes claim their channels before
   anything else can block them (if present). Add `--impedance <ohms>` for the
   controlled ones (USB/Ethernet/LVDS/balanced-RF; from `/find-high-speed-nets`).
   May peel far-apart "terminal" pads (e.g. spread-out test points) off the coupled
   chain and leave them for the signal-routing step (reported as
   `single_ended_followup_nets`, issue #121).
2b. **Impedance-controlled single-ended nets** (only if `/find-high-speed-nets`
   found any - RF/antenna feeds = 50 ohm, DDR SSTL = 40 ohm). A dedicated
   `route.py --impedance <ohms>` pass, routed here - after diff pairs, before the
   bulk signal route - because they need a stackup-derived width and a short,
   direct path over a clean ground reference, so (like diff pairs) they must claim
   their channel before the bulk signals fill the area. Route an RF feed on an
   outer layer (`--layers F.Cu`); requires a real stackup (see Step 2 stackup
   check). These nets are then EXCLUDED from step 3.
3. **Signal Routing** - All remaining nets, **excluding the plane nets AND any
   single-ended impedance nets from step 2b** (`--nets "*" "!GND" "!VCC" "!RF"`).
   Routing the plane nets as tracks would defeat the planes step; re-routing the
   impedance nets here would drop their controlled width - both exclusions are
   mandatory. This step also finishes any diff-pair pads peeled off in step 2, so
   keep the diff-pair nets in its selection (the `"*"` covers them).
4. **Power Planes** - Create GND and VCC planes together. Stitching vias adapt
   around the routed signals; the reverse is not true - a stitching via placed
   early can block the only clean channel for a diff pair (issue #56). If signal
   tracks boxed in a power pad, add `--rip-blocker-nets` so the blockers are
   ripped and rerouted.
5. **GND Return Vias** - Add return current vias near signal vias (when GND planes
   present); folds into the planes call with `--add-gnd-vias`.
6. **Plane Repair** - Reconnect any broken plane regions
7. **Verification** - DRC and connectivity checks

### Example Plan Output Format

Present the plan to the user as a numbered list with explanations:

```
## Routing Plan for board.kicad_pcb

### Board Summary
- 2-layer board (F.Cu, B.Cu)
- 174 nets, 25 components
- Unrouted (0 existing traces)

### Components Requiring Special Handling
- **U9 (PGA120)**: 120-pin grid array - use bga_fanout.py for signals only

### Differential Pairs
- None detected

### Power/Ground Nets
- **GND**: 42 pads - use plane on B.Cu
- **VCC**: 23 pads - use plane on F.Cu (or wide traces if planes not desired)

---

## Step-by-Step Routing Commands

### Step 1: Fanout U9 (PGA120) - All Non-Plane Nets
Generates escape routing for ALL nets on the component EXCEPT those that the
planes step will handle. This ensures every signal net gets fanned out,
avoiding `--no-bga-zone` workarounds during routing.

**Important:** Use `"*" "!GND" "!VCC"` to fan out all nets except the power
plane nets. Do NOT use `"/*"` alone, as it misses nets with non-hierarchical
names like `Net-(U9-Pad1)` which would then require `--no-bga-zone` to route.

On a 4+ layer board also pass every copper layer with `--layers` (default is
F.Cu B.Cu only) so inner balls can escape — drop `--layers` only for true
2-layer boards.

python3 -X utf8 bga_fanout.py board.kicad_pcb \
    --component U9 \
    --nets "*" "!GND" "!VCC" \
    --layers F.Cu In1.Cu In2.Cu B.Cu \
    --output board_step1.kicad_pcb \
    2>&1 | tee /tmp/step1_fanout.txt

**Then check the `JSON_SUMMARY` line: if `failed > 0`, balls were dropped — retry
before continuing.** First confirm all copper layers are passed; then re-run with
`--clearance` at the manufacturing floor (e.g. `--clearance 0.1`), which fixes the
common case (an 0.8 mm-pitch BGA can't fit a track between balls at 0.2 mm). If still
short, add the fine-pitch escape via and/or a smaller `--track-width`. Only proceed
to Step 2 once `failed == 0` (or the remaining `unescaped_nets` are understood and
accepted).

### Step 1b: Optimize Decoupling-Cap Placement (run after EACH BGA fanout — issue #130)
Nudges decoupling caps near the BGA off the foreign-net fanout vias (the
`PAD-VIA` violations #130) and pulls each pad toward its nearest same-net
ball. Run it on the just-fanned board, **before** signal routing. Use the
**same `--clearance`** you gave the fanout / your DRC floor — that's the only
setting that matters (it reads each via's real size from the board).

python3 place_fanout_clearance.py board_step1.kicad_pcb board_step1b.kicad_pcb \
    --clearance 0.1

It prints `Moved N cap(s); resolved R/M ... K unresolved`. Any **unresolved**
caps had no clear spot within the displacement budget — note them for a manual
nudge; they are not auto-fixed. By default (`--cap-prefix C,R`) it moves 2-pad
**caps and resistors** near a BGA (RN-style arrays auto-excluded since only
2-copper-pad parts move); it never overlaps parts, and is a no-op when nothing
collides. Feed `board_step1b.kicad_pcb`
into the next step (if multiple BGAs are fanned in series, run this once after
each, or once after the last fanout — it considers all BGAs' vias on the board).
Verify with `check_drc.py board_step1b.kicad_pcb -c 0.1` (PAD-VIA count drops).

### Step 2b: Impedance-Controlled Single-Ended Nets (only if any were found; runs before the Step 2 signal route)
ONLY when `/find-high-speed-nets` reported single-ended controlled-impedance nets
(RF/antenna feed = 50 ohm, DDR SSTL = 40 ohm). Route them in their own
`--impedance` pass, after diff pairs and BEFORE the general signal route, so they
claim a clean, short, direct channel at the stackup-derived width. Requires a real
stackup (run `/recommend-stackup` first if the board has KiCad's default). Route an
RF feed on an outer layer over the GND plane; recommend a `User.2` keepout +
`--keepout` around any antenna region (user draws it).

python3 -X utf8 route.py board_diff.kicad_pcb board_step2b.kicad_pcb \
    --nets RF --impedance 50 --layers F.Cu \
    --clearance <floor> --no-bga-zone \
    2>&1 | tee /tmp/step2b_impedance.txt

### Step 2: Route All Signal Nets (excluding plane nets + impedance nets)
Routes all remaining unrouted nets EXCEPT the nets that get planes in the
next step - the `"!GND" "!VCC"` exclusions are mandatory here, otherwise the
power nets get routed as ordinary tracks and the planes step has nothing to
do - AND any single-ended impedance nets already routed in Step 2b
(`"!RF"`), so the bulk pass cannot re-route them off their controlled width.
Routing signals before planes means the plane stitching vias (placed
next) adapt around the signals instead of blocking them.

For boards with BGA/PGA components, use `--no-bga-zone` to allow the router
to find alternative paths through the dense pin area (even when fanout was
done, some paths may require this). Use `--max-ripup 10
--max-iterations 1000000` for difficult 2-layer boards.

python3 -X utf8 route.py board_step1.kicad_pcb board_step2.kicad_pcb \
    --nets "*" "!GND" "!VCC" \
    --no-bga-zone \
    --max-ripup 10 \
    --max-iterations 1000000 \
    2>&1 | tee /tmp/step2_routing.txt

(When Step 2b ran, add its impedance nets to the exclusions, e.g.
`--nets "*" "!GND" "!VCC" "!RF"`, and route from `board_step2b.kicad_pcb`.)

### Step 3: Create Power Planes (GND and VCC) + GND Return Vias
Creates power planes in a single call, after signal routing so the stitching
vias find spots around the finished tracks. Each net is paired with its
corresponding layer (GND→B.Cu, VCC→F.Cu). Through-hole PGA/BGA pads
automatically connect to planes on their layer; SMD pads get vias routed to
the plane. `--add-gnd-vias` also places return-current vias near the signal
vias that now exist. If signal tracks boxed in a power pad, add
`--rip-blocker-nets` to rip the blockers out of the way (they are left unrouted
and reconnected by the Step 5c route.py pass).

> **Note to user:** GND return vias improve signal integrity for high-speed
> signals. Based on the speed analysis, this board has [speed_tier] signals,
> so `--gnd-via-distance` is set to [X] mm. If this is a purely low-frequency
> board (I2C/UART/GPIO only), drop `--add-gnd-vias`. Let me know if you'd
> like that.

python3 -X utf8 route_planes.py board_step2.kicad_pcb board_step4.kicad_pcb \
    --nets GND VCC \
    --plane-layers B.Cu F.Cu \
    --add-gnd-vias --gnd-via-distance 2.0 \
    2>&1 | tee /tmp/step3_planes.txt

Adjust `--gnd-via-distance` based on the board's highest signal speed:
- Ultra-high (>1 GHz): 2.0 mm
- High (100 MHz - 1 GHz): 3.0 mm
- Medium (10 - 100 MHz): 5.0 mm
- Minimum physical limit: 3 x (via_size + clearance)

### Step 5: Repair Disconnected Plane Regions
Signal traces and GND return vias may have cut through planes. This step
reconnects any isolated copper islands AND repairs pad-level plane connections.
With `--rip-blocker-nets`, a plane-net pad that can't reach its plane (e.g. a tiny
connector GND pin blocked by a signal trace) is connected by tracing to an
adjacent same-net pad, **ripping the blocking net out of the way**. The ripped
blockers are **left UNROUTED here** — they are reconnected by the route.py pass in
Step 5c, NOT inside this step. (Re-routing them in-step is unsafe: a ripped net
that fails to re-route had its original copper restored on top of whatever had
meanwhile been routed through its freed corridor, shorting them — the restore
bypasses the obstacle map. Issue #141 reverted; `--reroute-ripped-nets` and the
plugin's "Auto-reroute ripped nets" checkbox are now deprecated no-ops.) Carry
over Step 2's clearance/via/track-width/grid and `--no-bga-zone`.

python3 -X utf8 route_disconnected_planes.py board_step4.kicad_pcb board_step5_repair.kicad_pcb \
    --clearance <floor> --via-size <V> --via-drill <D> --track-width <signal_track> --grid-step <G> \
    --rip-blocker-nets \
    --power-nets <PWR...> --power-nets-widths <W...> [--no-bga-zone] \
    2>&1 | tee /tmp/step5_plane_repair.txt

**If it reports `Pads still unconnected` on fine-pitch (BGA/QFN ≤0.5 mm-pitch)
pads, retry the repair in this order — cheapest/safest first:**

1. **Smaller via first** — drop `--via-size`/`--via-drill` toward the **fab-floor
   / fine-pitch escape via** (e.g. `0.30/0.15`), but **never below the fab via
   floor**. A boxed fine-pitch pad usually fails because the repair *via* can't
   fit beside the ball; a smaller via fits in/near it and frees the connection.
2. **Then finer grid** — drop `--grid-step` (e.g. `0.05 → 0.025`), but **not below
   the board's minimum feature / your fab grid**. This is for the case where the
   pad connects by a *trace* to an adjacent already-connected same-net ball (the
   repair does this automatically): the trace is already thin, but at a coarse
   grid the A* can't thread the 0.65 mm-pitch BGA escape. **Measured on
   ottercast_audio: GND U1.N4 fails to route at `--grid-step 0.05` but connects
   to its neighbour ball at `0.025`** — it's a grid-resolution limit, not a width
   one (the trace runs at the thin signal track in both the A* and obstacle map).

Re-check `check_connected.py` after each retry; stop as soon as the pads connect
(finer grid is slower, so only escalate to it if the smaller via didn't do it).

### Step 5c: Reconnect the nets plane-repair left unrouted (mandatory if Step 5 ripped any)
route_disconnected_planes lists the blockers it ripped and left unrouted. Reconnect
them with a final route.py pass using the **same parameters as the Step 2 signal
route** — clearance/via/track-width/grid, `--no-bga-zone`, and the **same
`--power-nets`/`--power-nets-widths`** so a wide power net re-routes at its wide
width, not the signal default. route.py routes against the live obstacle map
(planes + repairs included) with safe rip-up/restore, so it reconnects them without
the shorts the old in-step reroute caused. This produces the canonical final board
`board_step5.kicad_pcb`. (If Step 5 reports it ripped nothing, you may skip this and
copy board_step5_repair.kicad_pcb -> board_step5.kicad_pcb **with `copy_board.py`, not
bare `cp`** — see the warning below.)

> **Never `cp` a board without its `.kicad_pro`.** A bare `cp step5_repair.kicad_pcb
> step5.kicad_pcb` copies only the board and strands the sibling `.kicad_pro`, which
> holds the DRC floor (the Default-netclass clearance/track/via the chain routed to).
> The next routing step then reads no project, resolves its floor from the STOCK
> (looser) netclass, and its writeback stamps that looser floor over tighter copper —
> so KiCad grades correct sub-floor copper as phantom clearance violations (icepi_zero:

> **`python3 copy_board.py src.kicad_pcb dst.kicad_pcb`** — it copies the board plus every

python3 -X utf8 route.py board_step5_repair.kicad_pcb board_step5.kicad_pcb \
    --nets "*" "!GND" "!<other_plane_nets...>" \
    --clearance <floor> --via-size <V> --via-drill <D> --track-width <signal_track> --grid-step <G> \
    --max-ripup 10 [--no-bga-zone] \
    --power-nets <PWR...> --power-nets-widths <W...> \
    2>&1 | tee /tmp/step5c_reconnect.txt

### Step 6: Verify Results
Invoke `/review-routed-board board_step5.kicad_pcb` for the full review (DRC,
connectivity, orphan stubs, length-match tolerances, GND return via coverage,
diff pair checks). If that skill is unavailable, run the raw checks — `check_drc.py`
**auto-grades at the `.kicad_pro` clearance the routing steps wrote** (the smallest
clearance any step used, including auto-stepped fine-pitch taps), NOT a hardcoded
0.25, so legitimately-tight fine-pitch escapes that are still fabbable don't read as
violations (#111/#226). A bare invocation is correct; pass `--clearance <floor>`
(from Step 4's `--design-rules` output) only to override:

python3 -X utf8 check_drc.py board_step5.kicad_pcb 2>&1 | tee /tmp/step6_drc.txt
python3 -X utf8 check_connected.py board_step5.kicad_pcb 2>&1 | tee /tmp/step6_connectivity.txt
python3 -X utf8 check_orphan_stubs.py board_step5.kicad_pcb 2>&1 | tee /tmp/step6_orphans.txt
```

**Coverage gate (mandatory — close the loop on Step 5b).** `check_connected.py`
already lists every net with ≥2 pads but no copper and no covering zone as
"Unrouted net with N pads" (it accounts for plane zones and ignores genuine
single-pad / no-connect nets). After planes + repair, **this unrouted list must
be empty** except for entries you can individually justify in writing (true
single-pad nets, deliberate no-connects). A fully-unrouted multi-pad net is a
coverage defect, NOT a shortfall to report-and-accept: it means a net fell
through the stage partition (Step 5b). For each one, go back and handle it —
route it, or add it to the plane step (a secondary ground gets its own pour
region per Step 5b) — then re-verify. Do not declare the board done while the
list has unjustified entries.

### Alternative: VCC as Wide Traces (No Plane)

If you prefer not to use a VCC plane, route VCC with wide traces instead:

```
### Step 1 (Alternative): Fanout U9 Including VCC
python3 -X utf8 bga_fanout.py board.kicad_pcb \
    --component U9 \
    --nets "*" "!GND" \
    --output board_step1.kicad_pcb

### Step 2 (Alternative): Route Signals + VCC as Wide Traces
python3 -X utf8 route.py board_step1.kicad_pcb board_step2.kicad_pcb \
    --nets "*" "!GND" \
    --power-nets VCC --power-nets-widths 0.5
```

Only GND keeps its exclusion (it still gets a plane in Step 3, now with
`--nets GND --plane-layers B.Cu` only). If VCC wasn't fanned out, add
`--no-bga-zone U9` to allow router access.

## Step 7: Check for High-Speed Signal Requirements

### Length Matching (DDR, high-speed buses)

For DDR memory or other length-matched buses, detect signals that need matching:

```python
# Common DDR signal patterns
ddr_patterns = ['DQ', 'DQS', 'DQM', 'DM', 'CLK', 'CK', 'CAS', 'RAS', 'WE', 'CS', 'ODT', 'CKE']
ddr_nets = [n.name for n in pcb.nets.values()
            if n.name and any(p in n.name.upper() for p in ddr_patterns)]
```

If DDR or length-matched signals detected, add to the plan:
- `--length-match-group auto` for automatic DDR byte lane grouping
- `--length-match-tolerance 0.1` for acceptable variance (mm)
- `--time-matching` if routes span different layers (accounts for dielectric)

### Impedance-Controlled Routing

For high-speed signals with impedance requirements:
- `--impedance 50` for 50Ω single-ended (calculates width per layer from stackup)
- `--impedance 100` with `route_diff.py` for 100Ω differential

### Bus Detection

For parallel data/address buses with clustered endpoints:
- `--bus` enables automatic bus detection and parallel routing
- Routes are attracted to neighbors, creating clean parallel traces

## Step 8: Handle Special Cases

### 2-Layer Board with Dense Components

On 2-layer boards, BGA/PGA fanout may fail for some inner pins due to
insufficient routing channels. Options:
- Accept partial fanout; router will complete remaining connections
- Skip fanout entirely; direct routing often works for through-hole PGA

**Dense 2-layer boards: treat B.Cu as a real routing layer, not a plane.**
Reserving B.Cu for a GND plane (and/or pricing it 3×) turns a congested
2-layer board into single-layer routing — neo6502's human original carries
47% of its routed length on B.Cu and pours GND *around* the routes on both
sides afterwards; our plane-first chain left 25 nets open. On a dense 2-layer
board: route signals on BOTH layers at cost 1.0 (long-haul nets cross on the
back), then pour GND last (`route_planes.py` after the signal steps — the pour
flows around existing copper). Only plane-first on 2-layer boards with light
signal content.

**Important:** If you skip fanout for a BGA/PGA component but still need to connect its
internal pads, use `--no-bga-zone <component>` to disable the automatic exclusion zone
and allow the router to enter the dense pin area:

```bash
python3 route.py board.kicad_pcb \
    --nets "*" \
    --no-bga-zone U9 \
    --output board_routed.kicad_pcb
```

Without this flag, the router auto-detects BGA/PGA zones and avoids them, which would
leave internal pads unconnected if they weren't fanned out.

### Multi-Layer Boards (4+ layers)

- Use inner layers for planes (In1.Cu for GND, In2.Cu for VCC). On a board with
  light-to-moderate routing density, **roughly half the copper layers as
  planes** works — on a 4-layer board that's In1+In2 as planes, F.Cu+B.Cu for
  signals.
- **EXCEPTION — dense boards (any BGA ≥ ~100 balls, DDR/SDRAM buses, or a
  signal step that already failed >5 nets): never plane ALL inner layers.**
  Corpus triage of the worst-connectivity boards (ulx3s, butterstick,
  orangecrab, zynq_ad9364) found this the single most damaging planning error:
  solid planes on both inner layers + 3× inner costs leaves a 2-layer board
  around the BGA, and 20–50 nets ship open while the human-routed originals
  route their long-haul nets *through* inner layers (1–2 vias each, the
  "cross-under highway"). On these boards: GND plane on ONE inner layer, and
  either keep the other inner layer a plain routing layer, or make it a SPLIT
  power plane (region pours per rail — `/recommend-plane-mappings` Step 3b) and
  keep its layer cost low (≤1.5) so signals can still cross in the gaps. On 6+
  layers, plane the middle layers and keep the layers at the BGA escape depth
  routable (human butterstick: planes In3/In4, DDR3 on In2/In5).
- **Check where the BGA fanout escapes landed before finalizing the plane
  layers** — a plane on a layer full of escape stubs forces `--rip-blocker-nets`
  to shred those escapes during tap placement (each rip risks a permanent
  casualty). Pick plane layers the escapes avoid.
- More fanout options available.

**Derive `--layer-costs` from the plane plan — penalize the plane-reserved
layers (issue #185).** The 4-layer default is **all 1.0**, so the router has no
idea which inner layers are about to become planes and freely routes signals
across them. Once you've decided the plane→layer map (via
`/recommend-plane-mappings` or the `route_planes` call you're about to make),
pass `--layer-costs` to the **signal** `route.py` step (and the later reconnect
passes) that makes each plane-reserved layer expensive, so signals prefer the
signal layers and leave the inner layers clean for the pour:
```bash
# GND plane on In1.Cu, power plane on In2.Cu -> penalize In1/In2 for signals:
route.py ... --layers F.Cu In1.Cu In2.Cu B.Cu --layer-costs 1.0 3.0 3.0 1.0
```
- **~3× is the sweet spot on boards where F/B alone can carry the signals.**
  Any value ≥2× keeps signals off the planes and doesn't hurt completion; ≥5×
  just adds vias/copper for negligible further gain. Order matches `--layers`;
  keep the real signal layers (F.Cu/B.Cu) at 1.0. **On dense boards (BGA ≥
  ~100 balls / DDR buses) where an inner layer was deliberately left
  signal-routable (see the dense-board exception above), keep that layer at
  1.0–1.5** — 3× on the only spare layer starves the long-haul nets that need
  it (ulx3s failed 72 nets at 3×; its retry at 1.5 was the correct call).
- **Why it matters — it's a cascade, not just tidiness.** Signals crossing a
  plane layer fragment the pour into islands; `route_disconnected_planes` then
  carpets the layer with island-stitching tracks. Keep signals off the plane
  layers and the planes stay whole, so the repair has almost nothing to stitch.
- **Measured on castor_pollux** (4-layer, In1=GND, In2=+3.3V/+3.3VA), full chain,
  default `1.0 1.0 1.0 1.0` vs smart `1.0 3.0 3.0 1.0`, both fully connected and
  DRC-clean:

  | | default | smart 3× |
  |---|---|---|
  | total segments | 4857 | **2966 (−39%)** |
  | signal copper on plane layers | 307 mm | **44 mm (−86%)** |
  | vias | 309 | 318 (+9) |

  The 39% segment drop is the carpet disappearing because the planes stayed whole.

This is the 4-layer analogue of the 2-layer rebalance in best-practice #8 / #178:
in both cases derive the costs from how the layers will actually be used, rather
than taking the blunt default.

### Differential Pairs Present

Insert diff pair routing after fanout but before single-ended signals:

```bash
python3 route_diff.py board.kicad_pcb \
    --nets "*LVDS*" "*USB*" \
    --diff-pair-gap 0.15 \
    --layers F.Cu In1.Cu In2.Cu B.Cu \
    --output board_diff.kicad_pcb
```

**Escape layers (multi-layer boards):** like `bga_fanout.py`, `route_diff.py`
defaults to `--layers F.Cu B.Cu` only. On a 4+ layer board you MUST pass every
copper layer — when a pair was escaped by `bga_fanout.py` onto an INNER layer,
`route_diff.py` can only launch from those escaped stubs if that inner layer is
in `--layers`. Omitting it strands the inner-layer stubs and silently drops
those pairs (you'll see a low routed-pair count, e.g. 8/40 instead of 22/40 —
issue #116). Use the same copper-layer list you passed to `bga_fanout.py`; drop
`--layers` only for true 2-layer boards.

Key options:
- `--diff-pair-gap 0.1` - Gap between P and N traces (mm)
- `--no-gnd-vias` - Disable automatic GND via placement near signal vias
- `--diff-pair-intra-match` - Match P/N lengths within each pair
- `--swappable-nets "*rx*"` - Allow target swap optimization for memory lanes

### QFN/QFP Components (Perimeter Pads)

Use `qfn_fanout.py` instead of `bga_fanout.py`:

```bash
python3 qfn_fanout.py board.kicad_pcb \
    --component U1 \
    --output board_qfn.kicad_pcb
```

Creates two-segment stubs (straight + 45° fan) for each pad. On a crowded
fine-pitch edge where the surface fan has no room, add `--escape-method underpad`
(drop a through-via past each pad) and, if a boxed-in leg still drops,
`--allow-via-in-pad` so the via can sit on its own pad and stagger inward — see
"Crowded fine-pitch QFN edge" above.

Like `bga_fanout.py`, `qfn_fanout.py` ends with a `JSON_SUMMARY` carrying
`drc_grazes` (graded at `--clearance`). **Parse it after the fanout:** if
`drc_grazes.segment_segment > 0` the 45° escape stubs of two adjacent tight-pitch
pads (often a diff pair) are grazing at the wrist — re-run with a thinner
`--width` toward the fab floor until it's 0 (issue #179; see the `drc_grazes`
bullet under Step 1). All pads keep escaping (`failed` stays 0).

### Power Net Width Options

Instead of routing power separately, use `--power-nets` with signal routing:

```bash
python3 route.py board.kicad_pcb \
    --nets "*" \
    --power-nets "GND" "VCC" "+3.3V" \
    --power-nets-widths 0.5 0.4 0.4 \
    --output board_routed.kicad_pcb
```

First matching pattern determines width. Useful when not using planes.

**Size power widths for the destination pitch, not just the current.** A
0.3–0.5 mm trunk physically cannot reach interior balls of a ≤0.8 mm-pitch
BGA (at 0.5 mm pitch only one ~0.09 mm track fits between balls; at 0.8 mm a
0.25 mm trace + 0.09 clearance is a knife-edge). The power step's automatic
tap neck-down helps at the pad, but if a rail feeds MANY interior balls
(core rails like +1V1/P1.35V/VCC_1V8), a fat-track tree through the ball
field fails outright — the human originals feed such rails with zones on
every layer plus 0.09–0.2 mm necks. For those rails prefer a plane/region
(`/recommend-plane-mappings`), or set the rail's width to what the ball
field admits (e.g. 0.15–0.2) rather than the open-field ideal.

### Target Swap Optimization (Memory Routing)

For swappable signals (e.g., memory data lanes where any DQ can connect to any):

```bash
python3 route.py board.kicad_pcb \
    --nets "*DQ*" \
    --swappable-nets "*DQ*" \
    --output board_routed.kicad_pcb
```

Uses Hungarian algorithm to find optimal assignments minimizing crossings.

### Schematic Synchronization After Swaps

When routing performs polarity swaps (P↔N) or target swaps, the schematic can get
out of sync with the PCB. Use `--schematic-dir` to automatically update:

```bash
python3 route_diff.py board.kicad_pcb \
    --nets "*LVDS*" \
    --swappable-nets "*LVDS*" \
    --schematic-dir /path/to/kicad/project \
    --output board_routed.kicad_pcb
```

This updates the `.kicad_sch` files with any pad swaps made during routing.

**Shared symbols are refused, not rewritten (#489 §3).** Pin numbers live in the
file's `lib_symbols` definition, which every instance of that `lib_id` shares. When
a second component uses the same symbol — the common case for connectors, identical
channels, and multi-channel analog — the swap is **refused** for that file with a
message naming the sharers, because applying it would silently re-pin those other
components too. The units of one multi-unit part (U2A/U2B) share the definition
legitimately and are still updated. A refused swap means board and schematic
disagree on those pins: report it and tell the user to fix it by hand (or give the
component its own uniquely-named symbol) before fabricating.

**Important:** After routing with swaps, ask the user:
> "The router performed X polarity swaps and Y target swaps. Would you like to
> update the schematic to match? If so, provide the path to your KiCad project
> directory and I'll re-run with `--schematic-dir`."

Schematic sync is **disabled by default** to avoid unexpected changes. Only enable
when the user confirms they want schematic updates.

### Guide Corridors (user-drawn preferred routes)

When specific nets keep taking bad paths (or the user wants control over where a bundle
runs), the user can draw a polyline on `User.1` in KiCad and re-route those nets with:

```bash
python3 route.py board.kicad_pcb --nets "SPI*" --guide-corridor --output board_routed.kicad_pcb
```

The route follows the line as waypoints, strictly best-effort — a guide never makes a route
fail or adds vias. See `docs/configuration.md` "Guide Corridor Options" for details.

**Scope rule: do NOT draw guide corridor geometry yourself.** Suggest *in words* where a
corridor would help ("a line on User.1 south of J3, between the mounting hole and C14") and
let the user draw it; then incorporate `--guide-corridor` into the plan.

### Keepout Zones (RF / analog exclusions)

Check the board for components that warrant routing exclusions: antennas (footprint/value
keywords ANT, ANTENNA, chip antenna parts), RF modules, and sensitive analog front-ends. If
found, recommend the user draw closed polygon(s) on `User.2` around those regions and add
`--keepout` to every routing step (`route.py`, `route_diff.py`) so tracks and vias stay out
on all copper layers. Same scope rule as guide corridors: describe where the keepout should
go; the user draws it.

### MPS Layer Swap (crossing conflicts)

When MPS ordering reports crossing conflicts (nets in Round 2+), or failures show pairs of
nets repeatedly ripping each other up, add `--mps-layer-swap` to attempt layer swaps that
eliminate same-layer crossings before routing begins.

### Vertical Track Alignment

On 4+ layer boards where through-hole components need via space, `--vertical-attraction-radius`
/ `--vertical-attraction-cost` attract tracks on different layers to stack vertically,
consolidating routing corridors.

### Plane Via Placement Options (route_planes.py)

- Multiple nets can share one plane layer (Voronoi partitioning): `--nets GND VCC --plane-layers In2.Cu In2.Cu`
- `--same-net-pad-clearance <mm>` forces plane vias outside same-net pads with that edge-to-edge clearance (default places at pad center when possible)
- `--rip-blocker-nets` rips up interfering routed nets to maximize via placement and leaves them unrouted (reconnect with a route.py pass afterward — Step 5c). `--reroute-ripped-nets` is a deprecated no-op.

### Net Ordering Strategies

| Strategy | Flag | Best For |
|----------|------|----------|
| MPS (default) | `--ordering mps` | General routing, minimizes crossings |
| Inside-Out | `--ordering inside_out` | BGA escape routing |
| Original | `--ordering original` | Manual control |

### Useful Utility Scripts

| Script | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `list_nets.py U1` | List all nets connected to a component |
| `list_nets.py U1 --pads` | Show pad-to-net assignments |
| `check_orphan_stubs.py` | Find traces ending without connection |

### Debug and Visualization Options

When routing fails or behaves unexpectedly:

```bash
# Verbose output with diagnostic info
python3 route.py board.kicad_pcb --nets "*" --verbose --output board_debug.kicad_pcb

# Debug geometry on User layers (visible in KiCad)
python3 route.py board.kicad_pcb --nets "*" --debug-lines --output board_debug.kicad_pcb

# Real-time visualization (requires pygame-ce)
python3 route.py board.kicad_pcb --nets "*" --visualize --output board_debug.kicad_pcb

# A* search statistics
python3 route.py board.kicad_pcb --nets "*" --stats --output board_debug.kicad_pcb
```

### Post-Routing Enhancements

```bash
# Add teardrop settings to all pads (improves manufacturability)
python3 route.py board.kicad_pcb --nets "*" --add-teardrops --output board_routed.kicad_pcb
```

### Advanced Routing Parameters

For difficult boards, consider tuning these parameters:

| Parameter | Default | Effect |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| `--max-ripup 3` | 3 | Max blocking nets to rip up and retry |
| `--max-iterations 200000` | 200000 | A* iteration limit per route |
| `--heuristic-weight 1.9` | 1.9 | >1 = faster but may miss tight routes, 1.0 = optimal |
| `--via-cost 50` | 50 | Higher = fewer vias, longer paths; lower (10-25) for BGA escape |
| `--grid-step 0.1` | 0.1 | Smaller = finer routing but slower; 0.05 for fine-pitch |

Manufacturing constraints (set to match your fab's requirements):

| Parameter | Default | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| `--clearance 0.25` | 0.25 | Track-to-track clearance (mm) |
| `--board-edge-clearance 0.5` | 0 | Min distance from board edge (mm) |
| `--hole-to-hole-clearance 0.2` | 0.2 | Min drill-to-drill spacing (mm) |

### Proximity Penalties

For dense boards, use proximity penalties to spread out routes:

```bash
python3 route.py board.kicad_pcb --nets "*" \
    --stub-proximity-radius 2.0 --stub-proximity-cost 0.2 \
    --bga-proximity-radius 7.0 --bga-proximity-cost 0.2 \
    --track-proximity-distance 2.0 --track-proximity-cost 0.1 \
    --output board_routed.kicad_pcb
```

## Important Notes

0. **Net-coverage invariant (Step 5b)** - Every routable net must be claimed by exactly one stage; a net excluded from one stage (`!X`) MUST appear in a later stage's selection. Reconcile the route-exclusion set against the plane `--nets` set before routing (symmetric difference empty), and confirm `check_connected.py`'s unrouted list is empty at the end. This is the guard against a net (e.g. a secondary ground like GNDA) being silently dropped by every stage.
1. **Always check for GND connections** - If a component has GND pads but GND isn't being fanned out, the plane vias will handle it
2. **Fanout ALL non-plane nets** - Use `--nets "*" "!GND" "!VCC"` to fan out all nets except those handled by planes. Do NOT use `"/*"` alone as it misses nets with non-hierarchical names like `Net-(U9-Pad1)`. Unconnected nets are automatically filtered out.
3. **Order matters** - Fanout, then diff pairs, then signals (always excluding plane nets with `"!GND" "!VCC"` exclusions), then planes + GND return vias, then repair. Signals route first because stitching vias can relocate around tracks, but a diff pair cannot relocate around a badly placed via
4. **Verify at the end** - Always run DRC, connectivity, and orphan stub checks
5. **Consider the analyze-power-nets skill** - For complex boards where power net identification isn't obvious, use that skill first to analyze component datasheets
6. **Consider the find-high-speed-nets skill** - For accurate GND return via distance recommendations based on actual component datasheet speeds and rise times, run `/find-high-speed-nets` before planning. The lightweight inline analysis (Step 4) uses net name patterns only.
7. **Stub layer switching is on by default** - The router automatically moves stubs to eliminate vias when beneficial; disable with `--no-stub-layer-swap`
8. **Default layer costs** - 2-layer boards default to F.Cu=1.0, B.Cu=3.0 to prefer top layer; 4+ layer boards use 1.0 for all. On **dense** 2-layer boards this 3× back-side penalty can over-bias routing onto F.Cu (top channel exhausted, B.Cu empty, excess vias, stranded pads); if completion is low or the layer balance is badly skewed, **retry with more balanced `--layer-costs` (e.g. `1.0 1.5`, down toward `1.0 1.0`)** — see "Dense 2-layer boards: rebalance layer costs" under Diagnose and Retry (issue #178). On **4+ layer** boards the all-1.0 default is plane-blind: **derive `--layer-costs` from the plane→layer map and penalize the plane-reserved inner layers (~3×)** so signals stay on F.Cu/B.Cu and the planes stay whole — see "Multi-Layer Boards (4+ layers)" (issue #185).
9. **Schematic sync is disabled by default** - After routing with swaps, offer to re-run with `--schematic-dir` if the user wants to update their schematic
10. **Rip-up and reroute is automatic** - When a route fails, the router automatically rips up blocking nets and retries (up to `--max-ripup` blockers)
11. **Component shortcut** - Use `--component U1` to route all signal nets on a component (auto-excludes GND/VCC/unconnected)
12. **Use --no-bga-zone for difficult boards** - Even when fanout is complete, use `--no-bga-zone` during routing to allow the router to find alternative paths through the dense pin area. This is especially important for 2-layer boards where routing channels are limited.
13. **Windows UTF-8 encoding** - On Windows, use `python3 -X utf8` to avoid Unicode encoding errors when scripts print special characters (like Ω for resistance). Example: `python3 -X utf8 route_planes.py ...`
14. **BGA/PGA power pins and planes** - When using power planes, BGA/PGA power pins (GND, VCC) connect most efficiently via direct vias to the plane rather than fanout routing. Create planes first, then fanout only signal nets. Through-hole PGA pads automatically connect to planes on that layer; SMD BGA pads need vias placed by `route_planes.py`. This approach:
    - Reduces routing congestion (power pins don't consume escape channels)
    - Provides lower impedance power connections
15. **Aggressive parameters for 2-layer BGA/PGA boards** - Use `--max-ripup 10 --max-iterations 1000000` from the start for boards with dense components. These parameters help resolve routing conflicts that would otherwise fail.
16. **Guide corridors and keepouts are user-drawn** - Never draw `User.1` guide polylines or `User.2` keepout polygons yourself; suggest in words where they should go and let the user draw them, then add `--guide-corridor` / `--keepout` to the plan.
17. **Companion skills** - Defer to `/identify-diff-pairs` (datasheet-based pair detection), `/recommend-stackup` (before impedance/time-matching work), `/diagnose-routing-failures` (after failures), and `/review-routed-board` (final verification) rather than duplicating their logic inline.

## Presenting the Plan

After generating the plan:
1. Show the board summary
2. Explain any special components found
3. List differential pairs if detected
4. Highlight any length-matching or impedance requirements
5. Present each step with the command AND a brief explanation of why
6. Ask the user if they want to proceed or modify the plan
7. Offer to run the commands if approved

## After Routing Completes

### Capture Logs for Analysis

Always capture command output to `/tmp` files for later analysis:

```bash

```

(`<floor>` = the manufacturing floor from `list_nets.py --design-rules`, not the
0.2 default — grade DRC at the rule the board's own Constraints + fab capability
define, per #111/#115.)

### Parse Logs for Failure Analysis

After routing, parse the log files to understand failures:

```bash
# Check routing summary (last 20 lines usually have the summary)
tail -20 /tmp/route_output.txt

# Look for failed nets
grep -i "failed\|FAILED" /tmp/route_output.txt

# Check JSON summary for detailed failure info
grep "JSON_SUMMARY" /tmp/route_output.txt | sed 's/JSON_SUMMARY: //' | python -m json.tool

# Find specific failure reasons
grep -A5 "FAILED NET HISTORIES" /tmp/route_output.txt
```

The JSON_SUMMARY line contains structured data including:
- `failed_single`: List of failed single-ended net names
- `failed_multipoint`: List of nets with unconnected pads (includes pad coordinates)
- `blockers`: Per still-failed net, which routed nets wall it off (`blocked_by` with cell counts; #409)
- `multipoint_pads_connected` vs `multipoint_pads_total`: Connection success rate

### Tune mode (issue #153) — opt-in per-board feedback loop

When the user asks for **tune** (e.g. "plan routing with tune", "tune mode"),
don't just run the standard pipeline once with defaults: close the loop.
After EACH step, read the step's own diagnostics and adjust that board's
options before moving on. Off unless requested — the standard plan stays
deterministic and fast.

Rules of the loop:
- **Bounded, guided adjustment — not a grid sweep.** At most 2–3 targeted
  re-runs per step, each driven by a diagnosed failure mode (the symptom→knob
  table below and the failure-pattern table in Diagnose and Retry). Never
  loosen below the fab/board-constraint floor.
- **Signals to read after each step:** the `JSON_SUMMARY` line (failed nets,
  `rescue` block, `single_ended_diff_pairs`/`failed_diff_pairs`,
  `drc_grazes`), the FAILED NET HISTORIES block (`preexisting_blockers`
  hints, `no rippable blockers`, iteration exhaustion), fanout escape
  tallies (unescaped balls), and plane-step tap/`ripped`/`STILL FLOATING`
  reports. `/diagnose-routing-failures` automates most of this.
- **Symptom → knob map** (beyond the Diagnose and Retry table):
  - Fanout drops balls in one quadrant → re-run that fanout with
    `--escape-method underpad`, a smaller via from the fab ladder
    (0.30/0.15 → 0.25/0.15), or different `--primary-escape` direction.
  - Signal step fails a cluster of long cross-board nets while an inner
    layer is plane-reserved → revisit the plane→layer map (dense-board
    exception above): free one inner layer, drop its `--layer-costs` entry
    to 1.0–1.5, re-run the failed nets.
  - `preexisting_blockers` hints repeat for the same nets → re-run those
    nets with the hinted `--rip-existing-nets` set (the engine now
    self-escalates once in reconciliation; a manual retry may widen the set).
  - Power multipoint pads fail inside a BGA courtyard → shrink that rail's
    `--power-nets-widths` entry toward the ball-field width (0.15–0.2) or
    promote the rail to a plane/region and re-run.
  - Diff pairs deferred single-ended → re-run the pairs with smaller
    `--diff-pair-gap`/width/vias toward the fab floor (keep `--impedance`).
  - Plane step ships tap failures with fill nearby → re-run
    route_disconnected_planes with a larger `--max-search-radius`, or at the
    advanced fab tier so smaller tap vias fit.
  - A handful of nets fail on a NOT-saturated board (few failed nets, short
    detours available, failures share a corridor with early-routed nets) →
    try a **failed-first split**: re-run the step as two invocations, first
    `--nets <the failed nets>` on the clean input, then everything else to a
    fresh output. Ordering is the cheapest knob but rarely decisive:
    measured on castor / butterstick / ddr5 / glasgow, an automatic
    failed-first restart NEVER beat the normal order (twice it graded
    worse), so an in-engine restart was tried and removed — only reach for
    this manually when the failure histories actually show corridor
    competition, and expect it to matter on few boards.
- **Explainability:** keep a short tuning log per board — which knob changed,
  the before/after metric (completion / DRC / coupled pairs), and whether it
  helped. Revert a change that didn't help before trying the next.
- **Honest gates:** grade every accepted retry with `check_connected` AND
  `check_drc` at the routed clearance (plus the kicad oracle for final
  boards) — never accept a retry that trades new DRC for completion.

### Diagnose and Retry

After running routing commands:
1. Report how many nets were routed successfully
2. **If routes failed**, invoke `/diagnose-routing-failures <board> <log files>` — it parses
   the JSON summary, failed-net histories, and blocking reports, correlates failures
   spatially, and outputs a targeted retry command. Apply its recommendation. If that skill
   is unavailable, fall back to this table:

| Failure Pattern | Likely Cause | Solution |
|-----------------|--------------|----------|
| "no rippable blockers found" | Route blocked by non-rippable obstacle | Use `--no-bga-zone`; if pads are "boxed in by static obstacles", shrink geometry / finer grid (see "Congestion escalation" below) |
| "Re-route FAILED: no path found" | Ripped net couldn't find new path | Increase `--max-iterations` |
| Many multipoint pads failed on same component | Congested area | Use `--max-ripup 10` or higher; shrink geometry toward the fab floor (see below) |
| Many failures cluster in one channel/region | Tracks too fat for the channel | **Congestion escalation**: re-route the failed nets at smaller track/via/clearance down to the fab floor (see below) |
| 2-layer board: low completion, via count far above a hand layout, or copper badly skewed to F.Cu while B.Cu sits empty | Default B.Cu cost (3.0×) over-penalizes the back layer | Retry with balanced `--layer-costs 1.0 1.5` (down toward `1.0 1.0`) — see "Dense 2-layer boards: rebalance layer costs" below |
| Routes near BGA boundary failing | BGA exclusion zone too aggressive | Use `--no-bga-zone` |

```bash
python3 -X utf8 route.py board_prev.kicad_pcb board_routed.kicad_pcb \
    --nets "*" \
    --no-bga-zone \
    --max-ripup 10 \
    --max-iterations 1000000 \
    2>&1 | tee /tmp/route_retry.txt
```

   Key parameters for difficult boards (especially 2-layer with BGA/PGA):
   - `--no-bga-zone` - **Critical**: Allows router to enter BGA area for alternative paths
   - `--max-ripup 10` (default 3) - More rip-up attempts to resolve conflicts
   - `--max-iterations 1000000` (default 200000) - 5x more search iterations
   - `--stub-proximity-radius 10 --stub-proximity-cost 3.0` - Spread out fanout stubs (optional, for aesthetics)

#### Dense 2-layer boards: rebalance layer costs (issue #178)

On 2-layer boards the router defaults to per-layer costs **F.Cu=1.0, B.Cu=3.0**
(best practice #8) to keep most signal copper on top. But with a GND/power plane
already filling B.Cu, that 3× back-side penalty can over-bias routing onto F.Cu:
the top channel fills up while B.Cu sits nearly empty, the router takes long F.Cu
detours that then need a via to reach a B.Cu pad, and on congested boards the
exhausted F.Cu channel strands pads that B.Cu could have carried. This is the
dominant route-quality gap on tight 2-layer keyboard/peripheral boards.

**When to suspect it** (check the route `JSON_SUMMARY` / `comparison` block, or
measure per-layer copper length and via count against a reference):
- Strong F.Cu skew — e.g. >80% of signal copper on F.Cu while B.Cu is sparse.
- Via count far above a hand layout (the F.Cu-detour-then-via pattern).
- Low completion with failed pads clustered where F.Cu is full but B.Cu is free.

**Retry with more balanced layer costs** so the router crosses to B.Cu for short
diagonal runs instead of detouring on F.Cu (order matches `--layers`: F.Cu first,
B.Cu second):
```bash
python3 -X utf8 route.py board_fanout.kicad_pcb board_signal.kicad_pcb \
    --nets "*" "!GND" "!VCC" \
    --track-width 0.127 --clearance 0.1 \
    --layer-costs 1.0 1.5 \
    --no-bga-zone --max-ripup 10 --max-iterations 1000000 \
    2>&1 | tee /tmp/route_balanced.txt
```
Start around **`1.0 1.5`** (down from the `1.0 3.0` default); if F.Cu is still
saturated, step to **`1.0 1.2`** or fully balanced **`1.0 1.0`** (fine when a
plane fills B.Cu — signals carve the pour and it reflows around them). This is
**complementary to**, not a replacement for, routing at the fab floor (below): a
balanced layer that's still too fat won't fit the channel either, so keep
`--track-width` thin. Re-route the **whole** signal step, not just the failures (a
victim is blocked by the successful F.Cu tracks already in its channel). Then
compare completion, via count, and F.Cu:B.Cu balance, and keep whichever connects
more pads with fewer vias.

Measured at `--track-width 0.127` (B/F = B.Cu:F.Cu copper-length ratio; both
boards stay 100% connected at every setting — the win is via count and balance):

| board | default `1.0 3.0` | `1.0 1.5` |
|-------|-------------------|-----------|
| urchin  | B/F 0.17, 177 vias | **B/F 1.01, 98 vias** |
| piantor | B/F 0.19, 102 vias | **B/F 1.85, 59 vias** |

`1.0 1.5` roughly **halves the via count** and pulls the layer balance from a
~6:1 F.Cu skew to near parity (the human urchin layout sits around B/F 0.89).
`1.0 1.0` lands in the same neighbourhood — pick the one with fewer vias.

#### Route signals at the FAB floor by default (thin is faster AND more complete)

**`track_width` and `via_diameter` are NOT DRC floors** (Step 4), and — this is
the subtlety — **the fab floor is NOT the board's `min_track_width` constraint
either.** Three different numbers get confused here; keep them straight:

- **Board `min_track_width`** (from `.kicad_pro`, e.g. ottercast = 0.2 mm) — the
  author's self-imposed DRC rule. Often conservative. Note `list_nets
  --design-rules` reports its "manufacturing floor" track as `max(this, JLC min)`,
  so it currently **clamps the track floor to this constraint** (0.2) and does NOT
  surface the finer fab capability — do not treat that printed track number as the
  real floor (it's right for clearance/via, just not for track).
- **Fab physical track minimum** (JLC ≈ **0.0889 mm / 3.5 mil** standard; **0.127
  mm / 5 mil** is the safe no-extra-cost width) — the actual floor. **This is the
  target.** It can be *below* the board's `min_track_width`: the human ottercast
  board routes most signals at 0.127 mm, under its own 0.2 mm constraint, which is
  exactly why it fits channels our 0.2 mm net-class tracks can't.

For ordinary signals there is **no benefit to routing fat** and a real cost.
Measured on ottercast_audio (signal pass, same clearance/grid, width only):

| Signal track width | Multipoint nets routed | Pads connected | Time |
|--------------------|------------------------|----------------|------|
| **0.127 (5 mil)**  | **122**                | **360/376**    | **2.69 s** |
| 0.15               | 118                    | 354/376        | 2.93 s |
| 0.20 (net-class)   | 103                    | 323/376        | 6.52 s |

Thinner is **monotonically better on both axes** — more nets complete *and* it
finishes faster (fat tracks cause ripup churn). So don't route fat and escalate;
**route the signal step at the fab floor from the start, and if still congested
go DOWN toward the fab physical minimum** (0.2 → 0.127 → 0.0889), not toward the
board's conservative `min_track_width`. There is no "knee" above the fab floor to
hunt for.

1. **Take the fab floor**, not the board constraint: the fab's physical track
   minimum (JLC 0.0889 mm / 3.5 mil; use 0.127 mm / 5 mil for a zero-cost,
   high-yield default). Going below the board's `min_track_width` is intended here
   — it's what the human did. (Keep DRC honest separately: grade at the clearance
   floor from `--design-rules`; a thinner track only *increases* clearance to
   neighbours, so it never creates a clearance violation.)
2. **Route the whole signal step at that width** (re-route everything, not just the
   failed nets — a victim is blocked by the *successful* wide tracks already in its
   channel, so thinning only the failures leaves the channel full):
   ```bash
   python3 -X utf8 route.py board_fanout.kicad_pcb board_signal.kicad_pcb \
       --nets "*" "!GND" "!VCC" \
       --track-width <fab floor, e.g. 0.127 or 0.0889> --clearance <floor, e.g. 0.1> \
       --via-size <floor via, e.g. 0.30> --via-drill <floor drill, e.g. 0.15> \
       --no-bga-zone --max-ripup 10 --max-iterations 1000000 \
       2>&1 | tee /tmp/route_signal.txt
   ```
   A finer `--grid-step` (0.05, or 0.025 for sub-0.4 mm pitch) is the complementary
   lever — a corridor that exists geometrically still needs a grid line on it to be
   found; pair it with the thin width at fine-pitch escapes ("boxed in by static
   obstacles"). If still congested, step the width down further toward the fab
   physical minimum and re-route.
3. **Keep only the nets that NEED width wide — by rule, not by sweep.**
   Power/high-current nets stay wide via `--power-nets`/`--power-nets-widths`, and
   impedance-controlled nets keep their calculated width (`--impedance`, or
   `route_diff.py` for pairs). Everything else routes at the fab floor. You do
   **not** need to find which signals are "genuinely congested": there's no reason
   to widen an ordinary signal at all, so the question never arises (and a net that
   passes wide can itself be the blocker of another, so a per-net width guess is
   unsound regardless).

3. **If swaps occurred** (polarity or target swaps):
   - Tell the user how many swaps were made
   - Ask if they want to sync the schematic
   - If yes, ask for the KiCad project directory path
   - Re-run the routing command with `--schematic-dir` added
4. Run verification: invoke `/review-routed-board` (falls back to the raw DRC and connectivity checks)
4b. **Apply the coverage gate (Step 6):** if `check_connected.py` lists any
   fully-unrouted multi-pad net, the board is NOT done — handle each (route or
   pour it) and re-verify before summarizing. Do not present an unrouted net as
   an accepted shortfall.
5. Summarize the final state of the board
6. **Offer to clean up intermediate files**:
   - List the intermediate `.kicad_pcb` files created (e.g., `board_step1.kicad_pcb`, `board_step2.kicad_pcb`, etc.)
   - Ask if the user wants to delete them, keeping only the final output
   - If yes, delete the intermediate files

Example cleanup prompt:
> "Routing complete. The following intermediate files were created:
> - board_step1.kicad_pcb (after GND/VCC planes)
> - board_step2.kicad_pcb (after fanout)
> - board_step3.kicad_pcb (after signal routing)
> - board_step4.kicad_pcb (after GND return vias)
>
> The final routed board is: board_step5.kicad_pcb
>
> Would you like me to delete the intermediate files?"
