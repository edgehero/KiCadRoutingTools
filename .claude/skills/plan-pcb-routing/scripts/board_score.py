"""One authoritative score for a board, so a loop can tell better from worse.

Why this exists
---------------
`place_route_loop.better()` compares `failures` and `iterations`, and BOTH come
out of route.py's own ``JSON_SUMMARY``. It never runs a checker. CLAUDE.md warns
about exactly this -- *"Routers can report false success. A router's own 'routed'
tally may come from a local/heuristic proxy while pads stay disconnected"* -- so a
round can be reported ACCEPTED while pads sit disconnected and DRC is dirty. That
is how a board went out at 39/44 nets with 762 DRC errors and 141/141 vias below
its own spec.

This script is the second opinion. It answers one question -- *is this board
better than that board?* -- with a number that cannot be produced by the thing
being graded.

It reimplements NO checking. Every component shells out to the real CLI, which is
deliberate and not laziness: `check_drc.main()` resolves the grading clearance
from the sibling ``.kicad_pro``, installs the per-layer ``.kicad_dru`` rules,
builds the per-netclass clearance map and derives the edge / hole-to-hole floors
(check_drc.py:2968-3045). Reimplementing that resolution here would drift, and a
grader that ignores the dru "will manufacture phantom flags on relaxed layers and
miss real ones on tightened layers" (CLAUDE.md). Subprocessing keeps the score
BY CONSTRUCTION equal to what `check_drc.py` itself reports.

The score
---------
Lexicographic, never a weighted sum -- a weighted sum lets a router buy off a
disconnected net with a lower via count::

    score = (blocking, quality)
    blocking = (unrouted + broken + drc + undersized + floorplan
               + impedance + length + net_widths)
    quality  = (vias, copper_mm, segments)      # only compared once blocking == 0

`blocking` must reach 0 before a board is deliverable. `quality` orders the
boards that already got there.

Vacuity
-------
"0 violations" and "0 rules ran" are different answers, and a loop that cannot
tell them apart will happily converge on a board nothing graded. Every component
reports `ran: true|false` plus a `reason` when it did not, and `blocking` is
`None` -- not 0 -- when a component that was asked for could not run.

Exit codes (deliberately the same dialect as check_floorplan.py)
    0  graded, blocking == 0
    1  crash
    2  bad arguments
    3  board state (missing file, unparseable board)
    4  graded, blocking > 0
