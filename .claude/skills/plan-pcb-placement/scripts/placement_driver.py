"""The placement workflow, one stage at a time.

A skill document is read all at once, which is how a 4,900-line one produced
executors that skimmed the gate and improvised the ladder. This script is the
tape head instead: you ask for one stage, it prints that stage's instructions
and nothing else, and it REFUSES to print a later stage until you hand it the
evidence the earlier one was supposed to produce.

The refusal is the point. A gate written in prose is a sentence someone skims;
a gate that withholds the next instructions cannot be skimmed past.

MEASURE this board's placement, then decide. Do not decide first.

The measurement is two commands and it is never optional. Skipping it is how a
board with two parts stacked on each other reaches routing -- every other
instrument in the chain looks at copper, and there is no copper yet.

Run BOTH, on the board with its copper removed. Neither alone is enough: the
first cannot see two parts stacked on the same net, the second is the channel
that can.

  python3 -X utf8 check_drc.py {a.board} --clearance <the board's own floor>
  echo "EXIT=$?"
  python3 -X utf8 check_assembly.py {a.board} --clearance <the board's own floor> \
      --json wk/assembly0.json
  echo "EXIT=$?"

check_assembly needs the floor SPELLED OUT: it defaults to 0.25 and does not
read the board. On a 0.2 board that grades stricter than the thing it is
grading -- measured, one board: pad_conflicts 96 at the default vs 39 at its own
floor.

Read the floor off the board (its .kicad_pro netclass or .kicad_dru), never a
round number you chose.

Every violation a COPPER-FREE board returns is a placement defect that no
router can remove.

Then classify by what you MEASURED, and say which row you are in:

  both clean                  -> the placement is fit. Do not run a pass over
                                 it: an optimizer on a placement that already
                                 passes makes it worse (measured -- the default
                                 weights caused two new routing failures). Hand
                                 the board to /plan-pcb-routing and stop here.
                                 This is a verdict you reached, not a default
                                 you assumed.
  board carries copper        -> STOP. Placement moves footprints, not tracks;
                                 the tools exit 3. Re-run from the unrouted board.
  unplaced                    -> P1

  rough/imported, all legal   -> P5 (a slate), or P4 for local violations only

   author the intent (P6), then seed from it:

   The seeder grades its own output against the same intent; exit 4 means the
   seed does not satisfy the intent it was built from, and says which rule broke.
3. Neither -> say so and STOP. This toolchain does not invent a placement, and
   inventing mechanical geometry is what every rule here forbids.

On a DAMAGED board that gate is usually unreachable by locking, and reaching
for it is the trap: a displaced part can carry a high-confidence finding, and
locking it records the damaged pose as a decision every later stage then treats
as ground truth. Disposition instead, per ref, against a measurement. The
advisor demotes a part lying WHOLLY off the board for this reason; a part
hanging PARTLY off an edge it cannot distinguish from a real edge-mounted one,
so that one is yours to judge -- compare its excursion with the other
edge-mounted parts on this board.

A part the FILE marks (locked yes) is never yours to move, whatever any intent
says. Place a part, verify it, then lock it -- never inherit a lock you have

The board is placed WRONG, not merely rough, so the quench is the wrong tool:
it is a local search on a continuous lattice, and what you have is a structural
error. Escalate, do not compose. Each rung has an applicability test; run the
test, and when it fails say so and fall through.

R1  Which parts did P2 establish? Their positions are arithmetic now.
R2  Does the BOARD determine a position? A family whose pattern is
    over-determined by its surviving members predicts the rest. The fit
    PROPOSES; the copper-free measurement DECIDES. Apply a proposal only when
      - the fit is over-determined (>= 2 survivors for a translation,
        >= 3 with rotation or scale), AND
      - the residual collapses to a grid step within a TOLERANCE, not to
        equality, AND
      - applying it improves the copper-free violation count AND does not
        increase the off-board amount.
    Both conjuncts, always: the count alone is gameable by evacuation -- a
    conflict removed by pushing a part off the board reads as an improvement.
    If it does not improve, REVERT: the determinant was not on the board.
R3  Apply with the repair tools, never the from-scratch seeder:
      python3 -X utf8 place_seed.py {a.board} r.kicad_pcb --intent fp.json --repair
      python3 -X utf8 place_reconstruct.py {a.board} r.kicad_pcb [--intent fp.json]
    Both take --dry-run and report what they WOULD do, and both take
    --deadline SECONDS -- BELOW THE SMALLEST CAP IN THE STACK, your harness's included. A 2400s deadline inside a 600s window can never fire: the harness SIGTERMs, the tool's own shutdown never runs, and you get exit 143 with no partial board and no summary. 143 and 124 are the SHELL's codes, not a tool's. Run long steps detached instead.
R3b A part whose pad CENTRES are off the outline is not repairable by a
    minimal-move sweep, whatever cap you give it: every repair search starts
    from the part's current pose, and that pose carries no information once
    the part is tens of millimetres out. LIFT it instead --
      python3 -X utf8 place_seed.py {a.board} r.kicad_pcb --intent fp.json \\
          --reseat --clearance <floor> --deadline 600
    (bare --reseat = auto scope = exactly those parts; name refs/globs to
    scope it yourself). Or as a ladder rung: place_reconstruct --stages
    classify,fit,vector,assign,exchange,reseat,legalize.
    THE NUMBER TO READ IS `witnesses_after`, NOT `repaired`/`reseated`: the
    first is what predicts routability, the second counts effort. Key it off
    render_placement's checklist.a_off_outline.pad_copper channel.
    Measured, same board: --repair 4m55s and attempted NONE of the 11
    off-board parts; --reseat 13s, 11 of 11, off-outline count to 0.
    Do NOT expect recovery to improve -- it seats by net centroid.
R4  Test for a rigid displacement. Offsets of +v and -v are AGREEMENT, not
    disagreement -- an exchange displaces its two groups by opposite vectors,
    and that pair is the swap's signature. Offsets disagreeing in MAGNITUDE
    mean there is no single rigid displacement: stop, go to P5.
R5  Anchor the large parts, then size the gap between two anchors from the
    SMALL PARTS that live in the corridor, not from the routing that crosses
    it (measured: small-part extent correlates with the gap a human left on
    8 of 8 boards; the routing cut does not correlate at all).

After ANY anchor move, re-run the escape ledger for every neighbouring
fine-pitch part -- a widened corridor can eat another part's escape face.

LOOK AT WHAT YOU MOVED. This stage moves parts, and the next one will not open
without a render of the result -- so produce it here, and READ it. --pair diffs
the findings BY NAME across the two boards, which is what says whether the move
fixed anything or just swapped one conflict for another (a level count hides a
swap):

  python3 -X utf8 render_placement.py r.kicad_pcb --before {a.board} --pair \\
      --clearance <the board's own floor> --ignore-nets <the poured nets> \\
      --expect-moved <the count this stage reported> \\
      --json-out wk/render_p3.json -o wk/render_p3.png

It prints WHAT THIS PANEL SHOWS (every finding in words), THE WORST N (one crop
command each) and DECLUTTER (the flags that clear the noise). Run one of the
crops it hands you; that is the whole point of it handing them to you.

One lap = measure, ONE targeted change, verify. Cap: 5 laps. Anything still
broken at the cap is NAMED with its measurement, not carried silently.

MEASURE (all four, every lap, on the copper-free board):

  python3 -X utf8 check_drc.py {a.board} --clearance <floor> --clearance-margin 0
  python3 -X utf8 check_assembly.py {a.board} --clearance <floor> --baseline {a.before}
  python3 -X utf8 check_channels.py {a.board} --clearance <floor> --track-width <floor> \
      --baseline {a.before} --gate
  python3 -X utf8 check_rigid_consistency.py {a.before} {a.board}

Pass <floor> to ALL of them. check_assembly defaults to 0.25 and check_channels
to --track-width 0.3, and neither reads the board: on a 0.2 board that default
width invented a "U2 N short 1 lane" deficit that does not exist (supply 14,
demand 12), and it was handed forward as floorplan-shaped residue.

The last three are DELTAS against the board you started from, deliberately.
Each has an absolute form that was measured and refused: a starved escape face,
a courtyard overlap and a contact pair are all routinely properties of the
DESIGN, so the absolute count fires on healthy and human-placed boards alike.
The delta cancels the design term because both boards carry it.

What each one refuses to let pass:
  check_assembly     a blocking pair (two parts on the same copper -- not
                     buildable whatever the nets), or copper on a LOCKED part
  check_channels     a face that now carries demand with no lane left, and did
                     not before
  check_rigid_...    a new contact between two parts moved by DIFFERENT
                     vectors -- impossible in a rigid restore, so the result is
                     a search that happened to fit, not the damage undone

FIX: one change, aimed at a named finding. The eaten_by refs in the channel
ledger are the move targets; the pair members in the assembly report are the
candidates. Do not batch fixes -- a lap that changes three things cannot tell
you which one worked.

VERIFY: re-run all four. A lap is ACCEPTED only if the finding it aimed at is
gone and nothing above it got worse.

Then record it, before starting the next lap:
  python3 -X utf8 converge.py record --ledger wk/ledger.jsonl \\
      --board {a.board} --kind placement --lever "<what you changed and why>" \\
      --argv <the real command that produced this board, as BARE TOKENS>

--argv takes the rest of the line, unquoted, and it must REPLAY: converge
refuses (exit 2) any first token that is not a real file or on PATH, and a
placeholder like "<all but R12>" inside a quoted string makes the whole thing
one unrunnable token. Expand the arguments you actually used.

A lap that did NOT clear its finding is recorded too, with --rejected, and then
stepped back. Keeping it is what makes "two flat laps" detectable -- a loop that
discards its failures cannot tell a plateau from a fresh start -- and the step
back is a checkout of the parent board, siblings included, not a reconstruction:

  python3 -X utf8 converge.py step-back --ledger wk/ledger.jsonl \\
      --out <where to put the restored board>

Two flat laps in a row means the residue is floorplan-shaped, not repairable
here: stop and go to P5.

EVERY LAP THAT MOVES A PART OWES A RENDER, and P6/P-close will not open without
one of the board they are handed. Re-render after each accepted lap, against the
board that lap came from:

  python3 -X utf8 render_placement.py <this lap> --before <the lap before it> \\
      --pair --clearance <floor> --ignore-nets <poured nets> \\
      --expect-moved <what the lever said it moved> \\
      --json-out wk/render_lapN.json -o wk/render_lapN.png

Read WHAT THE MOVE DID: `N fixed, M NEW` is the lap's verdict. A lap that
introduces findings it did not resolve is a lap to revert, and the count alone
will not tell you -- 46 -> 46 can be nine fixed and nine new somewhere else.

Record it: converge.py record ... --render-json wk/render_lapN.json

Prove the placement, then hand it on.

1. RE-MEASURE, exactly as P4 does, and put the numbers in the report. A verdict
   with no numbers beside it is an opinion.
2. Dispatch an INDEPENDENT verifier. Its prompt is a reference file, quoted
   whole -- do not paraphrase it, and do not read it as your own instructions:

<subagent_prompt agent="verifier" description="verify the placement">
Read {os.path.join(REFS, 'verifier-prompts.md')} and apply its placement
lenses to this board. Your inputs are:
    result   {a.board}
    before   {a.before}
    ledger   wk/ledger.jsonl
    intent   {a.intent_json or '(none -- waived on the record; see --waive)'}
Lens 1 (`intent`) needs that last file and was dispatched without it, so it had
no inputs and could not fail. It MUST fail on `rules_run == 0`: a grade that ran
no rules is a vacuous pass, not a clean board.
Re-derive every number yourself from the boards; do not trust the report.
Answer with a line beginning VERDICT= and nothing above it.
</subagent_prompt>

3. The report states, for each item: what was damaged, what changed, the
   measurement that says so, and what remains with WHY it is unfixable here.
4. Placement invalidates every downstream routed board. Say so, and hand the
   board to /plan-pcb-routing -- or to /plan-pcb-placement-and-routing if this
   run also routes.
5. Render the run. Every other artifact is a snapshot; this is the only one
   that shows WHICH lap moved what, and it comes straight off the ledger:

       python3 -X utf8 make_film.py --from-ledger wk/ledger.jsonl -o wk/place.mp4

   Rejected laps are in it too, badged -- seeing where the search went is the
   point. If it comes out one or two beats long, the laps were not recorded and
   the ledger is the thing to fix, not the film.

STOP conditions, name the one that applies:
  - every gate clean;
  - the residue named, measured, and shown unfixable at this stage;
  - two consecutive laps with no change (floorplan-shaped: needs a different
    arrangement, not another repair);
  - the 5-lap cap.
