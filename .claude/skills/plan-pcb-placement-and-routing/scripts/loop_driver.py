"""The loop BETWEEN placement and routing, one stage at a time.

The two halves each have a driver, and each keeps its own rules in front of the
executor one stage at a time. Their accept rules genuinely conflict -- placement
accepts a lap when the named finding it aimed at is gone, routing accepts an
iteration when `blocking` strictly decreased -- so an executor holding both
skills at once has two contradictory definitions of "better" live in the same
context. That is the confusion this driver removes: it never emits both.

What it adds beyond sequencing is the part nothing else owns:

  * the hand-off REFUSES without a placement close-out, so routing cannot start
    on a board whose placement was never proved;
  * a retry REFUSES without a stated classification, because the three failure
    shapes re-enter at three different points and cost is asymmetric -- a wrong
    parameter guess wastes iterations, a wrong placement guess wastes the whole
    routed board;
  * a placement-shaped re-entry MARKS every routed board stale, by name, so the
    next pass cannot quietly reuse one.

State crosses the boundary on DISK (the converge ledger), never in a head.
Delegation is a choice about context volume, not about correctness -- see
--delegate.

All three shapes look identical from inside the router -- nets that did not

asymmetric.

  parameter-shaped   grid, rip-up depth, layer costs, width. The router had a
                     path and did not take it.
                     Evidence: the failing nets have lane supply at their
                     escape faces, and the diagnosis names a knob.

  placement-shaped   a starved escape face, a part its net cannot reach. No
                     router setting adds a lane.
                     Evidence: check_channels shows the face carrying demand
                     with zero supply; check_reachability says CAGED.

  floorplan-shaped   a clause no arrangement at this placement satisfies.
                     Evidence: the constraint survives every parameter and

check_reachability answers about ONE pad per run -- give it a pad on a failing
net (or --net <id> --at <x,y>). Run it for each failing net you are
classifying; a single CAGED verdict is enough to make the shape placement.

Change ONE parameter. An iteration that changes three cannot tell you which one
worked, and the ledger entry it writes is unusable as evidence for the next.

Write to a FRESH output path -- board_R5_i2, not board_R5 again. The routing
steps write a sibling .kicad_pro carrying the DRC floor, and re-running to the
same path reads that floor back in, so the second run is not the first run with
one parameter changed: it starts from a different floor. The comparison the
whole iteration exists to make is then between two things that differ in two
ways. It also keeps the ledger's recorded sha pointing at a file that still
holds what was recorded.

Record it, then go back to L3 with the new score. If two parameter iterations
