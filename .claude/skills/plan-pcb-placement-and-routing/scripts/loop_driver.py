"""The loop BETWEEN placement and routing, one stage at a time.

The two halves each have a driver, and each keeps its own rules in front of the
executor one stage at a time. Their accept rules genuinely conflict -- placement
accepts a lap when the named finding it aimed at is gone, routing accepts an
iteration when `blocking` strictly decreased -- so an executor holding both
skills at once has two contradictory definitions of "better" live in the same
context. That is the confusion this driver removes: it never emits both.

What it adds beyond sequencing is the part nothing else owns:

  * the hand-off REFUSES without a placement close-out, so routing cannot start
    on a board whose placement was never proved;
  * a retry REFUSES without a stated classification, because the three failure
    shapes re-enter at three different points and cost is asymmetric -- a wrong
    parameter guess wastes iterations, a wrong placement guess wastes the whole
    routed board;
  * a placement-shaped re-entry MARKS every routed board stale, by name, so the
    next pass cannot quietly reuse one.

State crosses the boundary on DISK (the converge ledger), never in a head.
Delegation is a choice about context volume, not about correctness -- see
--delegate.

    A cycle ends when the loop re-enters placement after routing -- which is a

    all say `--stage L1`. The driver had no concept of one, and named the same
    output paths every time. Measured, on a real second cycle L2 printed:

        write the result to wk/run17/neo6502/frozen.kicad_pcb
        Take the list from wk/run17/neo6502/freeze_refs.json

    Both are CYCLE ONE's files. That `frozen.kicad_pcb` is cycle 1's
    `--authored-from` baseline and is referenced by the ledger by content hash,
    so following the instruction literally destroys the provenance every later
    gate checks against -- and check_complete's fab-floor check, which is the
    only route to UNSOUND, compares against exactly that file.

    Two refinements the real ledger forced, both about what is NOT a new lap:

      * routing before any placement does not start cycle 2 on the first
        placement lap (a routing-first run kept the bare names, as documented);
      * a placement row whose board content was ALREADY recorded produced no
        new board, so it is a disposition, not a lap. Measured: iteration 33 of
        the run-17 ledger is `kind: placement`, lever "cycle2 VERIFIER
        DISPOSITION (no pose change; same board as it.30)", and it re-records
        it.30's sha -- it read as a third cycle on a ledger whose own levers
        say cycle 2 throughout.

    THE STAGE MATTERS, and this is `starting` -- the third thing measurement
    forced. L1 is asked BEFORE its placement lap exists: at the top of cycle 2
    the ledger is [placement..., routing...] and no cycle-2 placement row has
    been written yet, so counting only placement phases returns 1 and L1 names
    cycle ONE's placed board -- the exact defect this function is for, still
    live on the one stage that opens a cycle. `starting=True` (L1: about to
    OPEN a placement phase) therefore counts the phase it is about to create
    when the ledger currently ends in routing. `starting=False` (L2 and after:
    about to route the placement that has just been recorded) reports the phase
    the current board belongs to.

    It does NOT err high: a cycle-2 placement lap that reproduces cycle 1's
    board byte for byte reads as a disposition and holds the count at 1. That
    is why the collision note exists beside it -- content-addressed, and it

DELEGATING: {why}.{_cycnote}{_clash}

Delegate the placement half to a TEAMMATE spawned with an agent type that HAS
the Agent tool -- `claude` or `general-purpose`, never `Explore` or `Plan`,
whose definitions exclude it. The placement skill dispatches its own
verification subagent at its close-out, and a half that cannot spawn cannot
verify itself. Give it the prompt below verbatim.

<subagent_prompt agent="claude" description="place {os.path.basename(a.board)}">
Drive the placement half of this board to its close-out, and do not route.

  board:  {a.board}
  ledger: {a.ledger}

Use /plan-pcb-placement. Ask its driver for one stage at a time:
  python3 -X utf8 .claude/skills/plan-pcb-placement/scripts/placement_driver.py \\
      --stage P0 --board {a.board}
and follow the stage it prints, including its refusals -- an <error> means a
gate is holding, so produce what it asks for rather than working around it.

Record every accepted lap with converge.py --kind placement into the ledger
above. The next stage checks the board against that ledger BY CONTENT HASH, so
a lap you did not record is a lap that did not happen.

{_clash}WRITE YOUR CLOSE-OUT TO THESE EXACT PATHS. They are named here rather than
chosen by you, because the next gate opens the files; it does not read your
message.

  placed board : {_placed}
  close-out    : {_asm}
                 python3 -X utf8 py_tools/check_assembly.py {_placed} \\
                     --clearance <the board's own floor> \\
                     --json {_asm}
  render       : {_rend}
                 the render_placement.py --json-out you actually READ
  freeze refs  : {_refs}
                 a JSON list of the refs whose pose is a DECISION -- moved
                 deliberately, or mechanically pinned. WRITE it: a pose diff
                 cannot tell a deliberate re-seat from a sweep, and it froze 76
                 moved parts where 24 were ever named. Not `must_lock`, which
                 `place_seed --repair` LIFTS.

`assembly_close.json` must be check_assembly.py's output and nothing else.
board_score.py publishes a field called `blocking` too and means something
entirely different by it; handing that over silently disables three of the four
checks the gate runs.
{FENCE_CLAUSE}

Return, and return ONLY:
  1. confirmation that each of the four paths above exists, or WHICH does not;
  2. what remains unfixed, each with the measurement that says it is unfixable
     at this stage;
  3. the refs you locked and why.
Do not summarise the process, and do not retype the numbers -- the gate
re-reads them from the files.

When it returns, continue here with --stage L2 on the paths named above.

Place this board yourself, driven. Do not read the placement skill end to end:
ask its driver for one stage at a time, so only one loop's rules are ever in
front of you.

  python3 -X utf8 .claude/skills/plan-pcb-placement/scripts/placement_driver.py \\

Follow it to P-close, including its refusals. Record every accepted lap into
{a.ledger} with converge.py.

--delegate forces a teammate for this half whatever the size, and
--no-delegate forces it inline. That is a context decision, not a correctness
one: the guards below are identical either way.

{freeze}

Freeze BEFORE you hand it over -- the locks are a decision from the placement
half, and a teammate that receives an unfrozen board cannot know which poses
were deliberate.

Then delegate the routing half to a TEAMMATE, for the same reason L1 does: use
an agent type that HAS the Agent tool (`claude` or `general-purpose`, never
`Explore` or `Plan`), because the routing skill fans out three verification
subagents at close-out and a half that cannot spawn cannot verify itself. This
half also produces the most output of anything in the loop -- a route log on a
board this size runs to thousands of lines -- so it is the one most worth
keeping out of this context.

<subagent_prompt agent="claude" description="route {os.path.basename(a.board)}">
Route this board to its close-out. The placement is FROZEN: do not move a
footprint, and if you conclude one must move, stop and say so rather than
moving it.

  board:  {_frozen}
  ledger: {a.ledger}

Route by FOLLOWING THE ROUTING SKILL, so the routing loop's rules are the
only ones in front of you:

  Follow /plan-pcb-routing on {_frozen}, one stage at a time, from its
  "How to run this skill" section onward.

Its Step 0 placement gate will pass: the placement half just did that work,
and the close-out is the evidence -- so it drops straight through to the
routing stages. Follow its refusals too -- when a gate holds, produce what it
asks for rather than working around it.

TAKE THE HAND-OFF PICTURE before your first route. This is the last moment the
board is copper-free, so it is the only render that shows the placement ALONE --
afterwards every panel is placement plus whatever the router did:

  python3 -X utf8 py_tools/render_placement.py {_frozen} \\
      --clearance <the board's own floor> --ignore-nets <the poured nets> \\
      --json-out {_hoj} -o {_hop}

Anything its WHAT THIS PANEL SHOWS block names as off the outline, stacked or
hole-conflicting will still be there after the route, and no router setting
removes it. Keep that board: it is the baseline `check_channels --baseline`
needs, and you return its path below.

Set `--deadline` on every searching step, BELOW THE SMALLEST CAP IN THE STACK,
your harness's included. A 2400s deadline inside a 600s window can never fire:
the harness SIGTERMs, the tool's own shutdown never runs, and you get exit 143
with no partial board and no summary. 143 and 124 are the SHELL's codes, not a
tool's. Run long steps detached rather than raising the number.

Record EVERY accepted iteration into the ledger above with converge.py, and
every rejected one with --rejected before stepping back. The stage after this
one refuses a board that is not in the ledger, by content hash.

WHEN YOU CLASSIFY A FAILURE, THE CLASSIFICATION DECIDES WHO FIXES IT:
  - `parameter`  -- yours. Re-enter your own failing R stage, record the lap,
                    carry on.
  - `placement`  -- NOT yours. Stop and return it. Fixing it means moving a
                    part, which you are forbidden to do anyway.
  - `floorplan`  -- NOT yours. Stop and return it. Fixing it means a different
                    arrangement, which is the other half's job.
A `placement` or `floorplan` verdict ends your turn. Do not spend router
parameters on it: that is the most expensive mistake available here, and a half
that fixes it locally is a half doing the outer loop's job invisibly.

{_clash}WRITE YOUR CLOSE-OUT TO THESE EXACT PATHS. They are named here rather than
chosen by you, because every gate after this opens the files; none of them
reads your message.

  routed board : {_routed}
  score        : {_score}          board_score.py --json
  route log    : {_log}           the one carrying JSON_SUMMARY
  close-out    : {_close}
                 python3 -X utf8 check_complete.py {_routed} \\
                     --authored-from {_authored} \\
                     --json {_close}

`--authored-from` is given to you above because only this loop knows it, and it
is not bookkeeping: without it check_complete's fab-floor check cannot run at
all, so UNSOUND becomes unreachable and a board that ships copper below its own
declared floor reads clean. The writeback only ever loosens, so the board you
were handed is the last thing left to compare against.
{FENCE_CLAUSE}

Return, and return ONLY:
  1. confirmation that each of the four paths above exists, or WHICH does not;
  2. the three routed-board VERDICT= lines, verbatim, one per line -- the
     ledger's own --final refuses without connectivity, drc and spec;
  3. SHAPE=<parameter|placement|floorplan>, or `none` if nothing failed;
  4. the failing nets BY NAME, not counted;
  5. anything left UNGRADED, named as unexamined rather than clean.

Do not summarise the process, and do not retype the numbers.

IF A STEP RUNS LONG, HAND BACK -- do not wait on it. You cannot: a teammate has
no way to sit on a backgrounded process and be woken when it exits, and both
routing halves in run 20 returned "still working, I'll wait" for exactly that
reason. Launch it detached WITH --deadline, then return three things and stop:
  LOG=<where it is writing>   MARKER=<the file whose appearance means done>
  NEXT=<what consumes it>
This loop arms the wait and resumes you. That is a correct hand-back, not a
failure -- report it as one and it will be read as one. The marker must be
written by the STEP, never by you: a "done" file you write before returning says
the work finished when it has not started.
</subagent_prompt>

When it returns, continue here with the paths it named. Do not retype its
numbers -- the gates re-read them from disk.

Two rules that are only true HERE, where the halves meet:
  - copper is not evidence about placement. A route that completed does not
    ratify the placement it ran on, and one that failed does not condemn it.
  - every routed board produced from THIS placement is valid only while this

Its Step 0 placement gate will pass: you just did that work, and the close-out

TAKE THE HAND-OFF PICTURE before the first route. This is the last moment the

names as off the outline, stacked, or hole-conflicting will still be there after
the route, and no router setting removes it -- so if that list is not empty,
read this stage's refusals again before spending a routing pass on it.

blocking = {blocking}. Name the SHAPE before choosing anything.

You have the focus panels ({a.render_json}). Say in one line what they showed --
one pocket or scattered -- and let that lead the evidence below, rather than
being reverse-engineered to agree with it.

All three shapes look identical from inside the router -- nets that did not
route. What separates them is a measurement, and the cost of guessing is
asymmetric.

  parameter-shaped   grid, rip-up depth, layer costs, width. The router had a
                     path and did not take it.
                     Evidence: lane supply at the escape faces, congestion near
                     the pre-placement baseline, and a diagnosis naming a knob.

  placement-shaped   a starved escape face, a part its net cannot reach, OR an
                     arrangement too tangled to route as a whole. No router
                     setting adds a lane or removes a crossing.
                     Evidence: check_channels shows a face carrying demand with
                     zero supply; check_reachability says CAGED on the
                     COPPER-FREE board; or crossings sit far above the board
                     placement started from.

  floorplan-shaped   a clause no arrangement at this placement satisfies.
                     Evidence: the constraint survives every parameter and
                     every local move.

Measure it, do not infer it from how the failure feels:

  python3 -X utf8 py_tools/check_channels.py {a.board} --baseline <the pre-route board> \\
      --clearance <the board's own floor> --track-width <the board's own floor>
  python3 -X utf8 py_tools/check_reachability.py <the COPPER-FREE board> --pad <REF.PAD> --json
  python3 -X utf8 py_tools/render_placement.py <the COPPER-FREE board> --json-out wk/cong_now.json
  python3 -X utf8 py_tools/render_placement.py <the pre-placement board> --json-out wk/cong_base.json

Three things that have each cost a run:

  * PASS check_channels the board's OWN track width. At its 0.3 default it
    reported a face "short 1 lane" that at the board's real 0.2 had supply 14
    for demand 12 -- an invented deficit, handed on as floorplan-shaped residue.

  * Run check_reachability on the COPPER-FREE board. On a routed board its
    geometry includes the ROUTER'S OWN copper, so CAGED there means rip-up
    depth, not placement. Measured: three genuine CAGED pads, all three
    PASSABLE once the copper was removed. Read the EXIT CODE, not the JSON
    `verdict` alone -- rc=2 is NO-TARGET, "the question was not answerable",
    and it is not a CAGED.

  * Both those tests are PER-NET, and simultaneous routability is not. A board
    can pass every one of them and still be unroutable. That is why `parameter`
    -- the answer a blind classifier gives by default -- is the verdict L4 makes
    you evidence: --congestion-json plus --congestion-baseline.

check_reachability answers about ONE pad per run -- give it a pad on a failing
net (or --net <id> --at <x,y>). A single genuine CAGED (exit 1) on the
copper-free board is enough to make the shape placement.

Change ONE parameter. An iteration that changes three cannot tell you which one
worked, and the ledger entry it writes is unusable as evidence for the next.

Write to a FRESH output path -- board_R5_i2, not board_R5 again. The routing
steps write a sibling .kicad_pro carrying the DRC floor, and re-running to the
same path reads that floor back in, so the second run is not the first run with
one parameter changed: it starts from a different floor. The comparison the
whole iteration exists to make is then between two things that differ in two
ways. It also keeps the ledger's recorded sha pointing at a file that still
holds what was recorded.

Record it, then go back to L3 with the new score. If two parameter iterations
in a row do not move `blocking`, the shape was probably not parameter --
re-measure rather than trying a third.

{why}

Confirm with the instruments, and put the numbers in the report beside the
names of the instruments that produced them:

  python3 -X utf8 check_complete.py {a.board} --clearance <floor> \\
      --authored-from <the board this chain STARTED from>
  python3 -X utf8 py_router/check_drc.py {a.board} --clearance <floor> --clearance-margin 0.1
  python3 -X utf8 py_router/check_connected.py {a.board}
  python3 -X utf8 py_tools/check_assembly.py {a.board}

check_complete is the one that fails CLOSED: board_score exits 0 with four of
nine components ungraded, and it has no component at all for orphan stubs,
weird copper or pad overlaps. --authored-from is what lets it see whether this
board grades itself against floors it rewrote -- the writeback only ever
loosens. Without it the check falls back to the project's own fab_floor_origin,
which is narrower (only the keys declared at the first writeback), so pass it.

Connectivity is orthogonal to DRC: a DRC-clean board can be entirely
disconnected, because isolated copper has no clearance conflicts.

Close the ledger with the stop condition NAMED and the three routed-board
lenses ATTACHED -- converge refuses --final without them, deliberately. The
VERDICT= lines come from the routed-board lens verifiers
(references/verifier-prompts.md; the routing half dispatches them at its
close-out) -- paste each line verbatim, FAIL included. A FAIL is compatible
with STUCK and BUDGET; it is only DONE-EXHAUSTED that no failing lens may
sit beside.

  {final_record_command(a.ledger, a.board, a.score, name)}

Then render the run. It is the only artifact that shows HOW the board got here,
and because both halves recorded into one ledger it is ONE film, not two:

  python3 -X utf8 py_tools/make_film.py --from-ledger {a.ledger} -o wk/run.mp4

And take the ONE still that shows whether the run made progress: the board this
run started from against the board it is ending with, at identical instrument
settings, diffed BY NAME.

  python3 -X utf8 py_tools/render_placement.py {a.board} \\
      --before <the board this RUN started from> --pair \\
      --clearance <the board's own floor> --ignore-nets <the poured nets> \\
      --json-out wk/run_pair.json -o wk/run_pair.png

Its WHAT THE MOVE DID block is the run's verdict in one place -- `N fixed, M
NEW` per finding class, plus crossings/hpwl/overlap before and after. Put those
numbers in the report. Two reasons they are not optional:

  * a level count hides a swap. "46 body stacks then 46 body stacks" can be
    nine resolved and nine created somewhere else, and only the by-name diff
    shows it -- the same reason the ledger records failing nets by name.
  * the discrete findings and the aggregate can disagree. On one run every
    finding class improved while `overlap_area` got WORSE (237.50 -> 239.02);
    a single scalar picks one and hides the other, and a report built on the
    flattering one is the failure this stage exists to prevent.

Report, per half, the number and the instrument beside it; say how many times
the loop turned and why each turn happened; and name anything UNEXAMINED rather
than reporting it clean. A chain that re-entered placement twice is not a
failure -- an unexplained one is.
