"""Score candidate (x, y, rotation) poses for a part, cheapest evidence first.

The pieces to answer "where should this part go, and facing which way" all
exist and none of them is joined up:

    legality of a pose      QuenchState.candidate_valid
    cost of a placement     QuenchState.total_cost  (wirelength, crossings,
                                                     halo, edge, alignment)
    the rotations to try    quench.ROTATIONS = [0, 90, 180, 270]
    does it actually route  route.py --nets <affected> --json-out

What did not exist is a function that takes a part and returns its candidate
poses RANKED. The one multi-pose scorer in the tree holds position fixed and
varies only rotation, so a part that needs to move 1.5 mm and turn 90 degrees
has never been scored as a single decision.

This module is deliberately only tiers 1 and 2 -- milliseconds, no router. Tier
3 (a scoped route of just the affected nets) and tier 4 (the full chain) belong
to the caller, because only the caller knows what "affected" means for its
board. The point of ranking here is that tier 3 is seconds and tier 4 is
minutes: you want to spend them on two candidates, not forty.
