"""Placement legality geometry: board side, true board outline, courtyard rects.

The single home for the geometric predicates that decide whether a placement is
LEGAL, as opposed to merely cheap. Both placement engines consume it:

- ``placement/quench.py`` -- the perturbative nudge/rotate/swap optimizer
- ``placement/fanout_clearance.py`` -- the decoupling-cap repair pass

and so can a placement grader: `placement_overlap_area` (total courtyard overlap
area) and `placement_out_of_board` are the two legality metrics the placement
scorecard needs (#456, feeding #411/#110), computed by the same code the
optimizers gate on rather than by a second implementation that can disagree.

Two things here are easy to get wrong and are therefore centralized:

**Board side.** Parts on opposite sides of the board overlap in XY without
overlapping in copper -- a back-side decoupling cap legitimately sits under a
front-side BGA. A side-blind clearance check calls that a collision, and since
only CANDIDATE poses are validated (never the incumbent), every candidate near
such a part is rejected and the part freezes in place. But a THROUGH-HOLE part
does occupy both sides: its leads pass through the board. So a part occupies its
own side with its full courtyard, and the opposite side only with the bounding
box of its drilled pads (`sides_occupied` / `rect_on` / `pair_min_gap`).

**The board is not its bounding box.** `board_bounds` is an axis-aligned bbox
(kicad_parser), so an inset of it is blind to an L-shaped outline, a notch, or an
interior cutout -- a part gets nudged into the hole. `BoardOutlineGate` measures
against the real Edge.Cuts rings, with the three-level short-circuit that makes
it affordable: board-level opt-out when the outline IS its bbox, a cached
per-part reachable-disk prune, then the exact ring test.

        EXACT, not a heuristic, and that is the whole reason it is safe to put

        separated from the rect's bbox by more than `margin` on EITHER axis,
        then every point of that edge differs from every point of the rect by
        more than `margin` on that axis alone, so their distance exceeds

        It is not usable in front of `edge_clearance`, which reports the true
        minimum distance rather than testing it against a threshold -- the
        nearest edge there may be arbitrarily far away.

        Why it matters: `edges_near` prunes per PART, sized by a displacement
        budget, and the seeder's state has no budget at all (pose_score builds
        its QuenchState without `build_neighbor_lists`, so `_travel_budget` is
        infinite and `edges_near` returns every edge). `_try_place` calls
        `rect_outside_amount` once per candidate offset, and `_offsets(16,

        a part whose own pads caused a contour to be reclassified as an inner

    CLAMP the output project's classes down to -- the netclass term alone is
    capped at it, in `for_board`'s map and nowhere else. The dru rules and the
    pad overrides run afterwards and keep outranking it, because the writeback
    does not touch either. `ceiling=None` (the default) is the documented
    "--clearance OMITTED" branch and leaves every tier as it was, which is why
    the two callers that write no project are untouched by it.

    Note the override enters as a max over BOTH pads: check_drc needs a second
    max at its own pad-pad call site for the same reason, because a pair is
    equally in violation when only the SECOND pad carries the keep-clear.

    `active` is False -- and every consumer then takes its original flat-scalar
    path unchanged -- when the board declares no netclass, no dru rule and no
    pad override. That is the common case, and the reason this cannot perturb
    an ordinary board.

    #735: the same `.kicad_dru`'s TRACK-scoped rules are carried too, in
    `track_rules` / `net_classes`, and answered by `track_pair` -- which is a
    separate resolver from `pair` and is **not** part of `active`. Both halves
    of that are deliberate. A track rule binds `A.Type=='track' &&
    B.Type=='track'`, so it can never price a pad pair, which is all `pair`
    is asked for; and `active` is the switch consumers use to drop this object
    entirely, so admitting a track-only board there would move
    `grade_pad_legality`, `quench` and every broad phase in
    `fanout_clearance` onto their resolved path to answer a question none of
    them asks. The one caller that does ask reads `track_rules` for itself.

    takes a footprint and scalars and reads no board -- a contract
    `tests/test_730_...py` pins, because six call sites build parts and a

    passed down. That is exactly the shape `fanout_clearance` already uses

    `max(clearance, NPTH_TO_TRACK_CLEARANCE, hole_clearance, lc)`

    decoration: a board staged into a temp dir and parsed from there carries a
    `source_path` that is not the board the caller means, and flat_hierarchy
    staged that way resolves 0.2000 where the real path resolves 0.2500 --
    which is exactly the 2.3500 -> 2.4000 radius this term exists for.

    Returns the plain fab floor when the board cannot be read, which is what a
    caller with no board gets by default. `notes` collects WHY, if a list is

class PartPads:
    """Pose-owning pad/hole model for one footprint.

    Offsets are captured in a seed-relative frame and re-derived per DELTA
    rotation (the `_Cap.pad_rects` pattern) because parser `pad.global_x` is
    stale after an in-memory footprint move -- this class owns the pose->pad
    transform. Half-extents fold `rect_rotation` into an axis-aligned bbox,
    exact for the axis-aligned pads that dominate placement and conservative
    for the rest.

    With a `PadClearanceModel` (#697) each copper pad also carries its
    required-clearance inputs in `pad_floors`, INDEX-ALIGNED with `pads_local`
    and therefore with everything `pad_rects` emits. Without one -- the default,
    and what the silk (labels.py) and extent-only (routability.py) consumers
    pass -- `pad_floors` is empty and `max_floor` is 0.0, so every caller keeps
    its original flat-scalar behaviour exactly.

    `pad_rects`' 6-tuple is deliberately NOT widened to carry the floor: it is a
    public shape (render_placement slices `r[:4]`, two test modules unpack it
    positionally) and the rect index already addresses the pad.

    NPTH holes are carried TWICE (#730), index-aligned: `holes_local` at the
    copper KEEP-OUT radius that `hole_circles()` serves, and `holes_extent` at
    the radius `extent_local()` needs. They differ only by the hole pad's own
    `local_clearance`, and only when a caller asks for it -- but the two
    questions are different in kind ("how close may copper come" versus "where
    is this part"), and answering the second with the first lets an author's
    keep-clear declaration push a part off the board outline.

    charged the bbox of pad CENTRES (a 0.9mm passive terminal contributing a
    zero-width body), `routability.face_lane_ledger` charged the COURTYARD (an
    assembly keep-out a track may legally run under). Neither is copper.

    `clearance` is NOT decoration. `holes_extent` carries
