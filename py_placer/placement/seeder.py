"""Generate an initial placement from a declared floorplan intent.

The placement stack refines; it deliberately does not place from scratch
UNAIDED (placement_state.py:13, docs/placement-optimization.md) -- handed a
pile of parts it has nothing to inherit constraints from. This module is the
aided path: the intent file IS the constraint carrier (zones, edge bands,
locks, decap rules), so a board whose repo declares one can get a legal,
deterministic, seeded starting placement instead of a refusal.

What each intent construct becomes, in placement order:

  1. ``edge_connectors``   the declared edge, overhang centered in the band,
                           distributed evenly along the edge. Placed WITHOUT
                           the legality gate: overhanging the outline is the
                           point, and candidate_valid would veto it.
  2. single-ref zones      the zone center -- the "few hundred microns around
                           the spec coordinate" pattern for spec-pinned parts.
  3. multi-ref zones       members packed radially from the zone center,
                           highest pin count first, constrained to the zone
                           rect plus its declared tolerance.
  4. everything else       nearest legal pose to the centroid of its already-
                           placed partners (fanout-capped, so GND does not
                           drag everything to the board middle) -- which is
                           also what lands a decap next to its IC.

Rotations: the input rotation is tried IN FULL first and kept when it fits;
a part with no contained legal pose at it falls back to its 90-degree
lattice, and the note names the change. The intent schema cannot express a
rotation, so a part whose rotation is a DECISION (pin order, the U3 rot-180
case) must be locked -- an unlocked load-bearing rotation was never
protected from the quench either. Explore rotations deliberately with
place_portfolio's `poses` strategy.

Determinism: the only randomness is ``random.Random(f"{seed}")`` -- it breaks
ties in the packing order and jitters non-spec targets, so different seeds
give genuinely different (still legal) seeds while the same seed reproduces
byte for byte. Everything else iterates sorted (#457).

    coarsen its step to afford it. Measured on splitflap_driver, R1 packed

    This is issue #629's measurement. Three consecutive sweeps in run 19
    returned a bare "no legal pose anywhere on the board" for SW17/SW34, and
    when the same question was finally asked in scoped form the engine
    answered precisely: with D14 in place 0 poses, with D14 lifted 46; with
    D31, 0 then 32. A verdict that names its blockers is the next move; a
    bare verdict is a dead end.

    Counts only -- no `apply_move`, no cost evaluation. It uses `pose_ok`,
    the same predicate `_try_place` seats on, at the state's own clearance
    (NOT the relaxed ladder): a count is meant to say whether there is room,
    and counting poses that only exist at a 0.02mm floor would promise seats
    the ordinary search does not take. Measured cost of that divergence on
    splitflap_driver: 4 of 65 movable parts census 0 while `_try_place`
    seats them on a relaxed rung, 6 of 65 with a zone. Reported, not fixed --
    see the paragraph above.

    **With a `constraint`, the zone is honoured and the SAMPLE SET comes
    from the zone too** (`zone_census_offsets`). Both halves are needed: the
    predicate alone leaves the census answering over a disc the zone
    excludes, and the disc alone leaves it counting poses that are outside
    the zone the seat had to satisfy. `radius`/`step` are ignored when a
    constraint is given -- the zone supersedes them.

    `without_keepouts` names declared keep-outs to LIFT for the sweep (#701).
    A keep-out is measured the way a blocker is measured -- count the poses
    with it out of the way -- so that "this keep-out is what refuses the
    part" is a NUMBER from the same predicate the seat search uses, not a
    static "does the zone intersect a keep-out" test computed some other way.
    A verdict derived from a different question is the reported-field trap
    one level up.

    the rule below is per-blocker-count: the same three conjuncts decide a
    pair, over a bigger snapshot. `blocker_zones` is the matching
    `(constraint_rect, tol)` for each blocker, in the same order.

    THE ACCEPTANCE RULE, in this order, every conjunct required:

      1. every seat was found -- `_try_place` seated `ref` (under its own
         zone) against the board with the blockers lifted, then seated each
         blocker (under ITS own zone, searching out from its old pose)
         against the board with `ref` in it. The blockers go back HARDEST
         FIRST (descending courtyard extent, then name), so the part with
         the least choice picks while the board is emptiest, and each one
         that lands is an obstacle to the next;
      2. all of them are legal against the FULL seated set, re-checked here
         with `pose_ok` at the clearance the seats were found at. The only
         parts excluded are the ones still in the pile, so `ref` and every
         blocker are obstacles to each other. This is the conjunct that does
         not trust the bookkeeping: the first version of this rung re-seated
         the blocker with `ref` still in its exclude set and landed it on top
         of `ref`, 100% inside its courtyard, and reported `unseated 0`;
      3. `_seated_violations` over the seated parts, `ref` now among them,
         has not increased against the board before the trade. This is the
         only ABSOLUTE pad-layer check in the rule: conjunct 2's pad test
         (`candidate_valid` -> `pads_ok`) is baseline-relative, "no worse
         than the SEED pose", and two parts that started stacked have a seed
         baseline that already contains a pad intersection -- so a re-seat
         whose courtyards are clear but whose pads intersect passes 2 and is
         refused here.

    HPWL is NOT a conjunct and is not a tie-break between anything, because
    there is one trade per part: it is recorded in the returned record for
    the reader. A gate that ranks it vetoes every legal seat over an
    unseated pile (see `_seated_violations`).

    Returns the eviction record. `accepted` says which branch ran; on the
    reverted branch every part is back at its snapshot pose and `reason`
    names the conjunct that failed. `blocker` is the FIRST blocker and is
    never None -- consumers union these into ref sets; `blockers` is the
    authoritative list at every depth. The caller
    owns `placed`/`unplaced`; this function reads them and restores every

    `exclude` carries the not-yet-placed refs: the pile they still form at
    their meaningless input coordinates must not veto real poses.

    candidate_valid alone is not the right gate here: for a part whose
    INCUMBENT pose is off the board (a generator's default position can be),
    its #456 branch accepts poses that move strictly TOWARD the board while
    still outside it -- measured: a free LDO seeded 2.7mm outside the
    outline, "placed", unseated 0. Placement from scratch has no incumbent
    worth improving on, so full containment is demanded explicitly; the only
    deliberate off-board poses are the edge connectors, which stage 1 places
    without this helper.

    The part's CURRENT rotation is tried in full first, then the rest of its
    90-degree lattice: an unplaced pile's rotation is a generator default,
    not a decision, and a large part can have NO contained legal pose at it
    while fitting fine turned 90 (measured: the same LDO, 0 poses at rot 0
    against 3 at rot 90 on a packed 51x21 board). A part whose rotation IS a
    decision must be locked -- an unlocked "load-bearing rotation" was never
    protected from the quench either (the U3 lesson). The caller can see a
    fallback fired by comparing the part's rot before and after.

    Returns the courtyard clearance the pose was found at, or None. The full
    clearance is demanded first; when the whole board offers nothing, the
    search reruns at half, then at a 0.02mm floor -- dense boards carry
    sub-clearance courtyard pairs BY DESIGN (the reference hand seed for the
    51x21 board places its LDO 0.04mm from a locked decap; a 0.05 floor
    still refused that board), and refusing to seed what a human
    deliberately packs would fail real boards. Courtyards carry their own
    margin, so a small courtyard-to-courtyard gap is not a copper hazard. A
    relaxed placement is a NOTE for the caller, never silent."""

    is the predicate it uses instead, and it has TWO parts because either
    alone was measured to accept an off-board part:

    * the measured overhang lies in the DECLARED band. Same quantity
      `floorplan.rule_edge_connector` grades on, so a seat accepted here is
      not a violation there.
    * EVERY PAD lands on the board. That is the invariant that actually
      matters -- CLAUDE.md calls pad copper outside the outline the
      top-priority placement defect, because it converts 1:1 into unrouted
      nets -- and it is the one a band cannot argue with. A band is an
      author's declaration and a wrong one is not rare: `{min: 3, max: 4}` on
      a 3.0mm-deep connector seated it with 1.7% of its courtyard on the
      board, and `{min: 20, max: 21}` was accepted on the east and west edges
      with 8 of 16 pads off.

    The pad test uses the gate's own containment, so a board with cutouts or
    milled rings is measured properly. A bounding-box test is not enough and
    was measured dropping 24 of 26 pads into a milled slot while reporting a
    seat: the pads were inside the bbox and inside a hole.

    An edge connector's BODY overhangs by design; its PADS do not. That
    asymmetry is what makes this checkable at all.

    A THIRD conjunct, since #701: a declared KEEP-OUT. An edge connector's
    body may leave the outline; it may not enter a region the intent
    reserved, and neither of the other two conjuncts can see that -- a
    mounting-hole keep-out on the north edge leaves the band satisfied and
    every pad on the board. This is the only place it can go: `pose_ok`
    demands full containment and an edge seat overhangs by design, so this
    predicate deliberately bypasses it, and BOTH edge paths come through
    here -- `_seat_edge`'s `on_board`, and stage 1 of `seed_from_intent`,
    which runs no legality gate at all by design. `reasons`, when given,
    collects WHY, so a refusal can name the keep-out instead of sending the

    format); `unseated` names parts NO legal pose was found for -- the caller
    reports them and the grade fails, deliberately.

    `seed_refs`, when given, scopes the seeding to exactly those refs: every
    other part is treated as authoritatively placed where it stands (the
    PARTIALLY-unplaced case -- a stacked pile beside a real placement, where
    re-deriving the placed parts would discard someone's work, and the
    LIFT-AND-RE-SEAT case -- see `reseat_scope`).

    `evict_depth` arms the eviction rung (stage 3c, #630): 0 (the default)
    censuses the blockers of every unseated part and moves nothing; 1 also
    trades the best SINGLE blocker out and back under `_evict_trade`'s
    acceptance rule; 2 additionally censuses PAIRS when no single lift frees
    a pose, and trades the best pair (#699). Opt-in until an A/B row on three
    boards exists (CLAUDE.md, "A new PLACEMENT objective term"). Nothing
    deeper is defined -- depth 3 raises rather than silently meaning 2.

    `immovable_extra` names seated refs the eviction rung may not lift on top
    of the intent's own locks. It exists because a caller's lock is not
    always IN the intent: `reseat_scope` resolves `--lock` globs into its own
    state and the seeder builds a fresh one, so without this the rung would
    happily evict a ref the user locked by name. It is deliberately NOT
    laundered through `must_lock`, which also drives stage 1.5, the
    file-lock/zone contradiction note and the `lock_refs` this returns (which
    `place_seed` STAMPS into the board).

# homecoming, and `after[oob] < before[oob]` is a complete rule. On an explicit
# scope the win is a declared claim or the scope's own wirelength, which the
# tuple cannot see AT ALL. That is why the explicit branch needs a term-wise
# safety condition plus a SEPARATE trigger, and why the answer is not an eighth
# tuple term (`measure` has no intent to measure, and
# tests/test_run8_gate_conjuncts.py pins the arity at 7 with its own reason).

    """LIFT a subset of parts and re-seat them FROM SCRATCH at their net
    centroids, holding every other part fixed as an obstacle.

    `evict_depth` (#699) is the ONE exception to "every other part fixed",
    and it is off by default. At depth >= 1 a scope ref with no legal pose
    may have a seated NON-SCOPE neighbour traded out from under it, under
    `_evict_trade`'s acceptance rule. Those refs are named in `evicted`, in a
    NOTE, and in `moves` -- they have to be in `moves`, because `moves` is
    the whole of what gets written, so an evicted part left out of it would
    be written at its OLD pose while the scope ref takes its pocket. At
    depth 0 the fixed-obstacle contract holds exactly and every code path
    below reduces to what it was.

    The contract that distinguishes this from `repair_placement`: **the part's
    current pose is never consulted.** Every other repair path in this stack --
    `--repair`'s cap ladder, `place_optimize`'s nudge, `place_portfolio`'s
    strategies, reconstruct's `{stay, +v, -v, pattern slot}` candidate sets --
    searches outward from where the part IS. That is the right question for a
    part that is nearly home and no question at all for one that is tens of
    millimetres out: a pose 30 mm from where a part belongs carries no
    information about where it belongs, and the cost of hunting from it grows
    with the cap while the chance of a hit does not. Measured on a 107-part
    board with 11 parts 7-32 mm off the outline: `--repair` spent 4 m 55 s and
    attempted none of them (its ladder tops out at 5 mm from the wrong centre);
    `place_reconstruct --max-move 40` ran over 8.5 min; this pass seated 11 of
    11 in 6.3 s.

    Not a recovery pass. It puts parts where the NETLIST wants them, not where
    they were, so `recovery` will not improve and `collateral_pad_rms` will
    grow. The number to judge it on is `witnesses_after` -- the count of parts
    whose pad centres are still off the outline -- because that is the one that
    predicts routability: on the board above, the same 11 refs carried a pad on
    every one of the 13 nets the router could not attempt, one for one.

    Scope: `refs` (fnmatch globs over the board's references), else AUTO =
    `reconstruct.damage_witnesses` -- refs with a pad CENTRE off the outline,
    which is the negation of a manufacturability invariant (you cannot solder
    to air) and is corpus-calibrated to ZERO on all 33 healthy boards. An empty
    scope returns `{'reseated': []}` and is a RESULT, not a failure.

    Every refusal is named in `notes`: a ref absent from the board, and a ref
    locked in the file or in the intent's `must_lock` (a locked pose is not
    this tool's to move -- the same rule `repair_placement` applies, for the
    run-7 reason recorded there).

    The scope's own `edge_connectors` declarations are DROPPED before seeding,
    and this is mandatory rather than hygiene: `seed_from_intent`'s stage 1
    places a declared edge connector with NO legality gate, at the middle of
    its band, and then walks it outward. Measured with the bands left in, on an
    intent auto-emitted from the damaged board, it threw TP4 to y = 30255 and
    R12 to x = -3971 -- thirty metres off an 81 mm board. A ref being re-seated
    has forfeited its band anyway: the band was measured off the pose being
    discarded.

    Gate, three conjuncts, because one lexicographic tuple is not enough here:

      1. Per-seat and structural, already free: `_try_place` demands full
         containment and `candidate_valid` -> `pads_ok` refuses any pose that
         worsens a pad pair, introduces an any-net stack, or worsens a hole
         shortfall.
      2. Board-wide `reconstruct.measure` with `edge_bands` computed EXCLUDING
         the scope, then a per-part `prune_assignment` sweep with
         `evidenced=scope` (a part coming back onto the board is gate-neutral
         on several terms by construction, exactly like the mounting-hole
         homecoming that rule was written for).
      3. A pass-specific conjunct the tuple cannot express, and it depends on
         `scope_source` (#698). See `reseat_accept`, which is the rule; in
         outline:

         * **AUTO scope** -- unchanged: `oob` must STRICTLY improve AND the
           witness count must not rise. The tuple's lexicographic comparison
           stops at the first differing term, and this pass moves `oob`
           (index 3) hugely in its own favour, which would HIDE a new stack,
           an hpwl blow-up or piled-on overlap below it.
         * **EXPLICIT scope** -- the same rule is unsatisfiable here, because a
           part that is legal and ON the board cannot move `oob` at all, so an
           explicitly named ref could never be re-seated whatever the search
           found. Instead: the witness count must not rise, no HARD gate term
           may worsen (`hpwl` is the one licensed term -- a seat made for a
           declared reason is hpwl-worse by construction), no declared claim
           may worsen termwise, and at least one basis in `RESEAT_BASES` must
           strictly improve. What stops a sideways move 'succeeding' is that
           `oob` is no longer the only thing measured, not that it is required.

    Returns `{'moves', 'reseated', 'refused', 'unseated', 'evicted', 'scope',
    'scope_source', 'notes', 'gate_before', 'gate_after', 'accepted',
    'accept_basis', 'witnesses_before', 'witnesses_after',
    'edge_bands_dropped', 'pruned'}`.
    `reseated` stays the SCOPE parts that moved; an evicted part is not a
    re-seat and is counted separately. `accept_basis` is the whole verdict --
    which basis carried the pass, what the safety half saw, and every basis
    that did not fire -- and it is present on EVERY return path, including the
    empty-scope early-out.

    NOT `placement/reseat.py`, which is a different mechanism for a different
    problem (Hungarian re-assignment of a proximity-tethered decap cluster onto
    rings around its anchor IC, refusing outright when the members' nets are
    rails). Do not merge them.
