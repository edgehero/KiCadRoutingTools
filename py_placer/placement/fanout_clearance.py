Fanout-clearance placement repair: tidy decoupling caps around BGA fanout.

Issue #130: a BGA fanout drops vias near the ball field. Where a foreign-net
via lands under a decoupling cap, the via copper overlaps the cap pad -> a
real PAD-VIA DRC violation at the clearance floor. The root cause is
*placement*, so the fix is to nudge the caps.

This runs AFTER bga_fanout.py (so the real vias exist), because the fanout
usually only escapes *signal* balls; GND/power balls are connected later by
dropping vias straight down. That gives two complementary goals:

  * AVOID  - a cap pad must clear, by `clearance`, every real fanout via of a
             DIFFERENT net (these are the #130 violations), plus any foreign
             escape track on the cap's own copper side (escapes can land on the
             bottom; the under-pad fanout deliberately routes through movable
             caps' zones expecting THIS step to move them, #278), plus any
             foreign-net COMPONENT pad (#235/#275: a move may never slide a cap
             pad onto a neighbour's pad -> a PAD-PAD short). All three are
             violations to FIX when present at the seed, not just to avoid
             introducing. Same-net vias/pads are fine - a cap pad may sit right
             on one (via-in-pad / same-net copper sharing).
  * ATTRACT - pull each cap pad toward the nearest BGA ball of its OWN net, so
             that a later GND/power via dropped at the ball also lands on the
             cap pad (one shared via connects ball + cap + plane).

Move set: small nudges within a per-cap displacement budget plus 90-degree
rotations. Cost = foreign-via penetration (strong) + same-net attraction +
displacement (mild, so caps stay near their seed). The board edge,
locked-part courtyards, AND other caps' courtyards are HARD constraints: a
move may never introduce or worsen a courtyard overlap, so caps never end up
on top of each other. A cap that can't clear a foreign via within the base
budget gets its budget grown and rotations enabled until it fits or hits the
displacement cap; if it still can't, it's reported unresolved.
