"""Was every pose in this board produced by a registered engine lever?

`fence_audit` asks a different question, correctly, and answers it every time:
*does any file in this work dir carry the control's poses?* That is the BLIND
question. Run 19 passed it -- `VERDICT: CLEAN, exit 0` -- on a run whose
placement came from a 221-line hand script, because a hand-arranged board
matches the control at ~0.0, nowhere near `MATCH_FRAC = 0.98`. There was
nothing for it to find.

The claim being made was a different one: *the engine placed this board*.
Nothing in the repo measured that. `FENCE_CLAUSE` gestures at it behaviourally
and concedes the limit in its own text ("nothing downstream can detect that it
happened"), and it says DISCLOSE, not refrain.

So this is an orthogonal sibling, not a replacement. Two questions, two
instruments, two manifests.

THIS IS AN ACCOUNTING BOUNDARY, NOT A SECURITY BOUNDARY, and saying so is the
honest register (`fence_audit.py:84-113` does the same for its own allow-list).
A determined author can call `declare_lever` from a hand script. What changes
is that doing so is an affirmative falsification rather than an omission -- and
because `provenance_audit` reconciles the DELIVERED BOARD's moved poses against
the ledger rather than reading the log alone, a forger must fabricate a
consistent `refs_moved` chain, which is a much larger act than skipping a
disclosure.

Registration is by explicit call, never by sniffing `sys.argv[0]`: sniffing is
defeated by one assignment, and a boundary that looks stronger than it is, is
worse than one that states its own limit.
