"""Floorplan intent: declare where things are supposed to go, then grade it (#549).

Every placement judgement in this toolchain collapses to "did `crossings` go
down". That number is indifferent between a sensible layout and a scattered one
with the same wirelength -- and a render only moves the judgement from a number
to a vibe. Nothing is ever *declared* about where parts belong, so nothing can
check whether they went there.

This module is the declaration and the check. An intent file says what the
floorplan is meant to be; `grade()` measures the board against it and returns
violations carrying the measured number next to the limit it broke. That makes
intent falsifiable: "the render looks fine" stops being available as a verdict.

THE BOARD OUTLINE IS NOT OURS TO CHANGE. `envelope` is READ from the board, not
authored -- `emit_intent` fills it from `board_bounds` and nothing here ever
writes Edge.Cuts. A part outside the envelope is a finding about the PART. Board
size, cutouts and slots are mechanical decisions (enclosure fit, panel rails,
connector apertures) that belong to the user; the honest response to a board
that is genuinely too small is to say so with the measured number and stop.

Design notes worth knowing before extending this:

* `refs` is the primitive for block membership, not `group`. Sheet group keys
  are opaque uuid paths (KiCad's Sheetname is absent from every corpus board),
  so nothing can author `"group": "sheet:1a2b3c4d"` without first listing the
  board. `group` is accepted, and matched against the raw key AND its
  `short_name` form, but globs over references are what a human or a model can
  actually write.

* A block that resolves to ZERO refs is an error, never a silent pass. A typo'd
  block grading clean is the exact failure this file exists to prevent.

* `rules_run` / `rules_skipped` are reported alongside the violation count. "0
  violations" and "0 rules ran" must not look the same to a machine.

* Every rule reuses the geometry the optimizer itself gates on -- `legality`'s
  `BoardOutlineGate` and `GradedPart`, `groups.decap_tethers`, `QuenchState`'s
  own `legality_metrics`. A grader with its own idea of "legal" grades the
  reimplementation, not the board.
