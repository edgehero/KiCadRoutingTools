"""When a board cannot hold its parts, say so WITH THE NUMBER and the options.

The prohibition this serves is written down in six places -- docs/floorplan-
intent.md:29-40, floorplan.py:14-19, check_floorplan.py:19-24,
rule_envelope:692, and both placement skills -- and every one of them says the
same sentence:

    the honest response to a board that is genuinely too small is to say so
    with the measured number and stop

The number was never computed. `out_of_board_area` is the nearest quantity and
`floorplan.py:347-360` explicitly DISQUALIFIES it as a budget key, because a
part sitting inside a cutout scores 0.0 area. Nothing sums a required area,
nothing re-runs a lane ledger at another layer count, and nothing converts a
face deficit into the millimetres of span that would clear it. So a run that
hits a genuinely too-small board can only stop, and the person reading it has
to go and measure by hand what to change.

THIS REPORTS; IT NEVER REFUSES AND NEVER ACTS. That is the house pattern from
`placement_driver._guard_congestion:779-823` -- "ok is False ONLY when the
evidence is missing; the numbers themselves never refuse... The executor
decides" -- and from `lock_advisor`, which prints a paste-ready `--lock` and
locks nothing, because a wrong auto-action fails invisibly.

Nothing here writes Edge.Cuts or a stackup. The only two things in the tree
that write an outline stay `kicad_writer.strip_zero_length_edge_cuts` and the
corpus tool `fix_outline_gaps.py`. This proposes with a number, exactly as
`recommend-stackup/SKILL.md:44` already does: "propose the nearest workable
option... Do not modify the board file directly -- stackup is a fab-facing
decision the user must own."

Every option carries the house shape:

    ran        bool -- False means NOT MEASURED, never "fine"
    reason     why it did not run
    measured   what this board is
    expected   what it would have to be
    action     the sentence or argv a human would act on, never run here

    Area alone is not enough, and getting that wrong is worse than not
    excluding at all. `CONTAINER_RATIO` is relative to the BOARD, so on a
    genuinely too-small board ordinary connectors cross it -- measured on a
    synthetically shrunk splitflap, 12 plain connectors were classed as
    containers, which would have suppressed the very parts causing the
    shortfall and understated the answer this option exists to give.

    A real container hosts the design: other parts sit INSIDE it. rp2350's U8

    nothing.

    Two conditions beyond that, each added because the first version of this
    guard failed the same way it was written to prevent:

      "hosting" twenty 0402s underneath it on B.Cu and got excluded, and a
      board whose true F.Cu utilisation was 1.10 reported `fits` at 0.55.
    * **NOT A PILE.** On an unplaced board every part shares one coordinate,
      so ANY part covering that point hosts 100% of the design. Measured on a
      shrunk, piled haasoscope: a BGA-256 and a BGA-529 were classed as
      containers and a real 524.86mm2 shortfall was reported as no shortfall
      at all. Two BGAs are not "a frame, not a body". Require the hosted
