"""
Greedy quench placement optimizer: perturbative refinement of an existing
(hand- or AI-made) placement to improve routability.

Starts from the current placement and repeatedly tries, for each component,
small moves within --max-displacement of its seed position plus 90-degree
rotations and same-footprint swaps, accepting only improvements
(zero-temperature anneal). Same-footprint swaps are accepted only if both
parts land within swap_max_displacement (default: max_displacement) of
their own seed positions. Locked components never move.

Cost = total airwire length
     + crossing_penalty * airwire crossings
     + halo penalty (soft whitespace around parts, scaled by pin count)
     + edge penalty (soft margin inside the board edge)

Legality (hard constraints, and the whole of what candidate_valid decides) lives
in placement/legality.py, shared with the fanout-clearance repair pass: parts
only collide with parts that share a board SIDE (a back-side decap under a
front-side BGA is not an overlap; a through-hole part's lead field does reach the
far side), and board containment measures against the real Edge.Cuts outline, not
its bounding box. A part whose SEED pose is already illegal is not frozen: it may
take any candidate that strictly reduces its violation.

The halo term spreads apart parts that are not pulled together by shared
nets — things that *can* be far apart may as well be, to leave routing room,
especially around high-pin-count parts.

Both airwire terms accept optional per-net weights (`net_weights`): a net's
airwire length is scaled by its weight, and each crossing is priced by the
larger of the two crossing nets' weights, so place_route_loop.py can bias the
whole objective toward the nets the router failed on. An unweighted board is
untouched, since max(1, 1) = 1.

            cost = orient_weight * sum_p ( |r| - r . u )

        Zero when a pad points exactly at its anchor, `2|r|` when exactly away,

        Why this rather than "score airwires from the actual pad", as #548
        proposes: the cost path ALREADY does that. `_net_points` emits one MST
        node per connected pad from `pad_globals()`, full rotation applied;
        there is no centroid anywhere in the objective. The gap is NUMERIC -- a
        ~1mm pad offset perturbs a ~20mm net's MST length by a fraction of a mm,
        less once the tree re-roots -- so the directional signal is present and
        drowned. This extracts the same signal at part scale and gives it its
        own weight.

        Two things it is NOT, worth stating: it is not purely rotational, since
        moving the part also changes `u`, so a large weight pulls a part toward
        its nets and overlaps the length term; and through `part_geometry_cost`
        it also reaches the group phase, so a rigid block translate is steered

        computing"). On a compliant board it is never computed at all.

        NON-STRICT (`<=`), unlike the #456 off-board branch's strict compare.
        That branch needs strictness because it hands out a licence to be

        `current - best > EPS + min_gain_per_mm * dist`, a strictly decreasing
        potential. The gate is a FILTER on which poses exist, not a descent
        direction, so equality cannot cycle. Strictness here would instead be a
        bug: `keepout_hit` reports a circle as a fabricated 1.0 marker, so
        `<` would freeze a part already inside a circle unless it could clear
        the whole circle in a single nudge.

        THE TRADE THIS MAKES, STATED. Because the conjunct sits ABOVE the #456
        off-board escape branch and returns rather than setting a flag, a part
        that is OFF THE OUTLINE and whose only reachable homeward poses lie in
        a declared keep-out stays off the outline. Measured on a fixture: the
        ungated run brings it 1.50mm inside the usable inset, the gated run
        leaves it 2.50mm outside. That trades a `keepout` finding for an
        off-board part, and CLAUDE.md ranks a part whose pad copper lies
        outside the outline as the TOP-priority placement defect, because it
        converts one-for-one into unrouted and broken nets.

        It is nonetheless the right ordering, for one reason: the alternative
        is a gate that can be defeated by first walking a part off the board.
        A declared keep-out that stops applying under some other violation is
        not a hard constraint. The honest handling is disclosure, not a
        loophole -- `intent_blockers` names the claim that stranded the part,
        and an intent whose keep-outs leave a part no way home is a
        contradiction its author has to see. `zone_covered_by_keepout` catches
        the total-coverage case at load time; the partial case is not caught

    align_weight / align_radius / align_span, orient_weight: the #548 tidiness
    terms, BOTH OFF by default. See QuenchState for what they measure and why
    they default to zero -- at 0.0 they return before touching any geometry and
    the output is bit-identical to a build without them.

    corridor_weight / corridor_specs: price the LENGTH each foreign airwire cuts
    through a declared bus corridor, rather than merely counting that it does.
    Off by default -- at 0.0 no corridor is built at all -- and NOT ADOPTED:
    measured on three boards it improved the re-derived corridor signal on one
    of them. The corridors must be frozen at construction (an unfrozen corridor
    makes the objective non-stationary), but a corridor is DEFINED by its bus's
    pads, so moving parts moves the corridor and the minimised gain does not
    survive re-derivation. Read `check_floorplan --health`'s `cut_mm` as a
    diagnostic instead. See docs/placement-optimization.md.

    net_weights: optional {net_id: weight} priority multipliers. A weighted
    net's airwire length is scaled by its weight and every crossing it takes
    part in is priced at max(weight_a, weight_b). Absent or all-ones leaves
    the cost exactly unchanged.

    metrics_out: optional dict, filled in place with the ratsnest and legality
    numbers this function already computes and used to print and discard (#504):

        {'before': {...}, 'after': {...}, 'legality': {...}}

    where before/after are `QuenchState.total_cost()` -- length, crossings,
    halo, edge, hpwl, total -- and legality is `legality_metrics()`. An
    out-param rather than a changed return type on purpose: the return is
    consumed positionally by both CLIs and four test files, and one of those
    binds this signature with inspect.signature. Same note/consume shape as
    plane_resistance's consume_resistance_results (#487).

    Reading them: `crossings` and `hpwl` are UNWEIGHTED (crossings is a raw
    count by contract; hpwl is pure pad geometry), so they are comparable
    across calls. `length` and `total` are scaled by net_weights, so they are
    only comparable between the before/after of the SAME call.

    groups: optional {block name: [reference]} from placement.groups. Each block
    gains a RIGID TRANSLATE move -- the whole body shifts by one offset, capped
    so every member stays within max_displacement of its own seed (#459). Absent
    or empty means no group phase runs and the result is byte-identical to the
    ungrouped engine, which is why grouping is opt-in.

    Returns a list of placement dicts (reference/new_x/new_y/new_rotation)
    for every movable part, whether or not it moved.
