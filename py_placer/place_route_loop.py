"""
Router-in-the-loop placement repair.

Routes the board, reads the failure diagnostics (failed nets + the blocker
nets named in the router's frontier analysis), and micro-quenches ONLY the
parts that could help those routes succeed:

  - parts owning pads of the failed nets (move the endpoint out of the
    congested pocket), and
  - parts owning pads of the blocker nets (move the anchor so the blocking
    wall re-routes),

with the failed nets given extra weight in the quench cost: their airwire
length and any crossing they take part in.
High-pin-count parts are excluded from targeting (--max-target-pins) - moving
a resistor that anchors a blocker net is low-risk; dragging a 144-pin QFP to
fix one net is how placements get destroyed.

The new placement is accepted only if a real re-route improves
(failures, router iterations), otherwise it is reverted and the next round
widens the displacement cap.

Usage:

      --route-args '--nets "/*" "Net-*" --track-width 0.2 ...' \
