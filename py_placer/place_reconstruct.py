"""Reconstruct a PLACED-BUT-WRONG board: the puzzle solver.

Usage:
  python place_reconstruct.py damaged.kicad_pcb repaired.kicad_pcb [--intent fp.json]

For boards whose placement is structurally damaged (swapped regions, dragged
selections, re-imported netlists) -- the case the nudge-scale quench and the
from-scratch seeder both fail. Pipeline (placement/reconstruct.py):
classify tiers (locked/mechanical frame -> anchors -> smalls), corner-inset
pattern fit on mounting holes (propose-only), rigid +/-v vector detection, an
EXACT simultaneous candidate assignment (small ILP via scipy.optimize.milp;
breakout-descent fallback), then a violation-driven minimal-move legalize
sweep. Every stage applies only if the legality gate tuple (pad conflicts,
hole shortfall, banded pad-oob, stack pairs, hpwl, courtyard overlap) does
not worsen -- see placement/reconstruct.measure() for the ordering rationale.

Exit codes: 0 wrote a board that improved (or matched) every gate axis with
no residual pad conflicts; 3 the board cannot be reconstructed here (no
outline / carries copper); 4 residual violations remain (board still written
for inspection).
