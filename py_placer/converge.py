"""Surgical convergence: rank a move before paying for it, and step back cheaply.

A convergence run is expensive in exactly one way -- routing -- and a loop that
re-runs a full chain for every candidate spends its whole budget discovering
things a millisecond of arithmetic already knew. Measured on one board: eleven
full-chain iterations bought about eight useful moves, and the run stopped with
five nets carrying no copper.

So: a ladder, cheapest evidence first, stopping as soon as a tier discriminates.

    tier 1  legality            QuenchState.candidate_valid      ms
    tier 2  placement cost      QuenchState.total_cost           ms
    tier 3  scoped route        route.py --nets <affected>       seconds
    tier 4  full chain          the caller's own                 minutes

Tiers 1 and 2 live in pose_score.py. This module adds tier 3 -- routing only the
nets a move can affect -- and the bookkeeping that makes a step back a checkout
rather than a reconstruction.

VERBS

    converge.py poses BOARD --ref U3 [--route] [--affected NET ...]
        Rank the part's candidate poses. With --route, also run tier 3 on the
        top few and report what actually happened to the copper.

    converge.py where BOARD --nets NET ...
        What is unconnected, where the gap is, and which foreign copper is
        walling it in -- via net_forensics, which already answers this and which
        nothing in the usual chain calls.

    converge.py record --ledger L --board B --kind completion --argv ...
        Store a board by content and record what produced it.

    converge.py step-back --ledger L [--to SHA|--iteration N] --out BOARD
        Check out an earlier board. Exact, because it is addressed by content.

    converge.py replay --ledger L --iteration N
        Re-run that iteration's lever verbatim. An entry that recorded only
        prose refuses, loudly.

    converge.py status --ledger L
        Iterations spent, split completion vs systemic. A budget going to the
        instrument rather than the board is the failure this makes visible.

    accepted lap left to produce: the gate demanded the one thing a finished
    half cannot make. A recorded rejection is exactly the evidence that a half

    An accepted lap whose score never measured `blocking` COUNTS AS A LAP but

    stopped. A rejection needs no score, because the rejection is itself the
