"""Headless PNG stills of placement status (#431).

A routed board is self-evidently inspectable: open it in KiCad, the tracks are
there. A placement repair is a set of position deltas whose merit is invisible
without the context that motivated it -- which airwires were failing, which nets
walled them off, what moved and how far. `docs/placement-optimization.md` names
the acceptance criterion ("output that is visibly 'your placement, nudged' can
be reviewed in minutes") but nothing produced an artifact to review.

This composes; it does not re-render. Every pixel goes through
`route_render.BoardRenderer` (board outline, cutouts, zones, pads, drills, the
caption HUD) via its `overlays=` hook, and every world->pixel conversion through
`renderer.tf`. There is no coordinate arithmetic in this file -- a test asserts
the rect handed to the drawing layer is `state.parts[ref].rect()` identically,
which fails the day someone inlines a courtyard transform.

    python3 render_placement.py BOARD.kicad_pcb [-o OUT.png|OUTDIR] [options]
    python3 render_placement.py BOARD --before SEED --arrows -o delta.png
    python3 render_placement.py BOARD --zoom-group sheet:1a2b --per-side -o dir/

Known limits, stated because the artifact should not oversell (the issue's own
list): a dense board does not fit one readable frame, which is why delta-first
and focused crops are defaults rather than polish; a flat image projects away
the layer dimension; and geometry is not causality -- arrows show WHAT moved,
never why it helped. The caption strip carries the verdict, and a render without
it invites exactly the wrong review heuristic.
