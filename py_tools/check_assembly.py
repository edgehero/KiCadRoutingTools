"""Is this placement physically BUILDABLE? The assembly gate (run-6).

One command, one verdict: the body-overlap channel (blocking = cross-
footprint pad intersections, corpus-calibrated to zero on healthy boards;
advisory = fab/courtyard pairs with class/intent waiver labels) plus the
pad/hole/oob legality echo -- both conjuncts in one JSON.

Needs NO intent to be meaningful (unlike check_floorplan's legality rule,
which skips without a budget): a bare board grades honestly. --intent adds
authored overlap waivers only.

--baseline <board> computes the loop currency: advisory pairs NEW relative
to the baseline board (dense real boards ship hundreds of by-design
courtyard kisses -- the corpus measured 235 -- so the placement fix loop
targets the pairs OUR moves introduced, never a shipped design's own).
--baseline also ARMS the courtyard gate (run-23): an unwaived courtyard
interpenetration past the area+depth floors flips the verdict when a member
MOVED relative to the baseline. Without a baseline the courtyard census is
report-only -- healthy human boards ship such pairs by design (measured:
5 of 34 corpus boards), so an absolute gate would be unshippable.

Exit codes: 0 = clean, 2 = usage/load error, 4 = a blocking pair OR copper
landing on a KiCad-locked part (see LOCKED-PART CONTACT) OR a coincident-
origin stack (see COINCIDENT ORIGINS) OR a containment OR a moved-vs-
baseline courtyard interpenetration (see COURTYARD BLOCKING).

    # GRADE AT THE BOARD'S OWN FLOOR, and say where that came from.
    #
    # This default USED to be a flat routing_defaults.CLEARANCE (0.25) that did
    # not read the board, while every router resolves the board's own Default
    # netclass first. So the tool routinely graded STRICTER than the board it
    # was grading. Measured on one 0.2mm board: pad_conflicts 96 at the default
    # vs 39 at the board's own floor -- `blocking` and `locked_contacts` were
    # identical, because those pairs are true pad INTERSECTIONS rather than
    # clearance grazes, which is why it survived this long.
    #
    # The previous decision here was to keep the constant and merely DISCLOSE
    # it, on the grounds that board_score and the stress harness shell this
    # tool and re-basing their numbers was the bigger change. That trade is now
    # reversed deliberately: a disclosure only helps a reader who acts on it,
    # and the run that motivated this read the numbers, not the note. The
    # re-basing is real but bounded -- it moves the pad/hole ECHO counts toward
    # the truth and leaves `blocking` (the field board_score consumes) alone.
    #
    # "Every board in kicad_files/ declares no floor and so is bit-identical"
    # is what stood here, and it is FALSE. Two project siblings are committed:
    #
    #     $ git ls-files kicad_files/*.kicad_pro
    #     kicad_files/flat_hierarchy.kicad_pro     Default clearance 0.2
    #     kicad_files/routed_output.kicad_pro      Default clearance 0.09
    #
    # so on those two this tool re-based from the 0.25 constant to 0.2 and to
    # 0.09. What IS bit-identical is the VERDICT, which is the weaker claim
    # that should have been made: measured at 5894b95^ vs HEAD, both boards
    # report pad_conflicts 0 -> 0 and buildable True -> True; only the graded
    # clearance and its recorded source moved. Grading at the board's own
    # clearance is right HERE because this tool grades existing geometry --
    # check_channels PREDICTS routability and therefore needs a fab floor
    # instead (see list_nets.board_floor, grade-vs-predict).
