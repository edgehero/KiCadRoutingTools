"""Are the routing channels open? The lane-ledger instrument (run-6).

Productizes the skill's per-face lane ledger (supply vs demand per escape
face of every fine-pitch part) and the anchor-pair channel widths -- the
numbers the placement gate reads before routing, and the classification
input for "is this failure floorplan-shaped": a face in deficit AT THE
FINEST LEGAL GRID is a placement/floorplan fact no routing parameter can
fix, and its `eaten_by` refs are the fix iteration's move targets.

REPORT-ONLY BY DEFAULT -- the corridor law is measured descriptive, not
prescriptive, so these numbers inform the loop and do not gate by themselves.
This line used to say "exit 0 unless the board is unreadable", which predates
two exits that now exist and is the kind of stale contract a caller reads
literally: with `--gate` the exits are **4** (NEW escape damage against
`--baseline`) and **3** (nothing had a ledger, so the gate did not run and must
not be recorded as a pass); **2** is an unreadable board or a flag outside its
domain, with or without the gate. Without `--gate` it is still exit 0
throughout.

"NEW escape damage" is three predicates, not one, and saying "a new STARVED
face" was accurate only until #847: a face can now fail the gate while still
having lanes to spare. `--json` keeps them apart (`starved_faces`,
`lost_escape_share`); the text output labels each line with which one fired.

V1 limitation, stated: supply-tap/via lane consumption is not modeled.

#: ONE BASIS, and it has to be said: the three glasgow rows are graded at
#: track 0.0889 / clearance 0.09, which is what `rL_repair` resolves. The
#: control board declares a DIFFERENT netclass (0.2/0.2), so run with no flags
#: it is graded at another basis and the two rows would not be a delta at all.
#: At its own basis that control exits 4 -- from `lost_last_lane`, on two

#: on it at either basis, which is what the 0.093 above is about.

#: called it "the geometric midpoint of 0.093 and 0.349". It is not: that is
#: 0.180, and the arithmetic mean is 0.221. The margins above are the honest
#: statement and are what the acceptance rule asks for anyway.) A FRACTION
#: rather than a
#: lane count deliberately: a lane count would have to be scaled by face
#: length, which varies by an order of magnitude on one board, while "this

    """(ref, face, demand, before, now) for faces that lost a SHARE of escape.

    The magnitude form of what `lost_last_lane` asks as a zero-crossing, and
    the reason it exists is that the zero-crossing MASKS real damage (#847).

    `lost_last_lane`'s predicate is `now == 0 and before > 0`, and both
    supplies fall as the escape band deepens -- so each face contributes an
    INTERVAL of bands over which it fires, and the gate is a union of
    intervals. Measured on the run-7 wrong-basin fixture: D22's north face
    goes 16 -> 0 and fires at bands 2.0 and 2.5, then stops at 3.0, not
    because it recovered but because its BASELINE also reached 0. "The
    baseline got worse too" is not evidence that the placement under test is
    fine, and that masking is exactly why `check_channels --gate` is
    non-monotone in a parameter no caller could even set.

    It also misses the damage the issue is actually about. At the shipped band
    the wrong-basin board's U1 east face falls 43 -> 28 lanes against a demand
    of 12 -- a 35% loss of escape, invisible to every predicate here before
    this one: `_starved_faces` needs supply 0, `lost_last_lane` needs a
    crossing to 0, and the deficit form sees nothing because 28 still exceeds
    12. That face is the one #847 names.

    WHO ATE IT, corrected -- an earlier draft of this paragraph said "eaten by
    U30" and that is wrong at this band. At the shipped band U1 east is eaten
    by C14(5.0), C76(4.75) and C6(3.2); U30 is not charged there at all, and
    `tests/test_run8_starved_face_gate.py` carries a passing arm asserting
    exactly that. U30 appears only at a 2.0mm band, which is #841's story, not
    this one. The distinction is not pedantic: `eaten_by` is advertised as the
    move target, so naming the wrong part sends a fix at a part that is not in
    the way.

    DELTA ONLY. The absolute forms are unchanged: `_starved_faces` still asks
    for supply 0, and `_deficit_faces` is still a report. A share-of-escape
    question has no meaning without a baseline to be a share OF.

    Unlike `lost_last_lane` this one IS filtered by --min-demand. What that
    conjunct actually buys, stated precisely because a first draft of this
    paragraph overclaimed it: it keeps the reported list off LOW-DEMAND NOISE
    -- without it the wrong-basin pair also names demand-1 diodes whose supply
    merely halved, 8 -> 3. It is NOT what keeps the controls quiet. Measured
    on the truth-restore pair at the shipped band, at --min-demand 0, 1 and 7
    and at a drop threshold of 0.15: zero hits in every combination. The
    controls are quiet because their worst drop is 0.093, below any threshold
    considered -- the separation does that work, not the conjunct. (Graded at
    the shipped pair's basis; see the constant above for why that has to be
    said, and for what the control does at its own.)
