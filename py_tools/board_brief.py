"""What a board looks like to something that has to place it, in one artifact.

The placement toolchain already emits every number an author needs -- escape
lane deficits and who ate them, block displacement, net affinity, part classes,
groups, lock advice, the render checklist and the crop that frames each
finding. What it has never had is one place to READ them from, so an author
(human or model) reassembles the picture from a dozen commands every time, or
does not, and places from a guess.

THIS MODULE ASSEMBLES; IT DOES NOT COMPUTE. Every number comes from the
function that already owns it, and `sources` names that function per section,
so there is one source of truth per fact and the brief cannot drift away from
the graders. The one exception is `fit`, which is opt-in and says so: it
answers "where does a W x H part fit at all", the question
`wk/run19/urchin/probe_space.py` was hand-written to answer and whose output
became that run's X0 = 46.0.

Two rules inherited from the evidence map
(.claude/skills/plan-pcb-routing/references/evidence-map.md):

    never read a picture on its own -- every render is paired with a number
    that either confirms or contradicts it, and the number wins

    keys are literal; if a key is not in the output you are looking at, you
    are looking at the wrong artifact

so `renders` is folded in only as a reference to a real `render_placement
--json-out` document, never re-derived here.

A section that cannot run says WHY, in `skipped`, and is absent from the body.
A brief that silently omitted a measurement would read as "nothing to report".

    this section adds is the evidence an author would otherwise have to
