"""Last-chance per-net fine-parameter rescue pass (issues #331 / #371).

Runs at the very end of batch_route, after the main loop, the rip-up ladder,
the reroute loop, Phase 3 tap completion and the #134 recovery have all had
their shot. Any net still failed outright (no result) or partially connected
(failed pads) gets a SCOPED retry at finer parameters:

  rung 0   - the run's own width/clearance at a finer grid (pure grid-
             resolution failures route cleanly here: rp2350_fpga_eensy
             /T8F49I2X/R failed at 0.05 and routed at 0.025 unchanged)
  rung 1.. - fab-floor track width with the clearance stepped down from
             nominal toward the fab floor (#371: the neck-down ladder was
             power-net-only; a below-layer-width retry gains nothing on the
             shared obstacle map because its inflation is baked at the layer
             width, so the neck-down needs this rebuilt scoped map anyway)

Design constraints (#331/#371 review):
  - NO rip-up here: the rescue routes through free space only, and each
    committed edge is verified to reduce the net's component count on the
    real board (else it is removed again) - a failed rescue leaves the
    board untouched.
  - Scoped, never board-global: a fresh obstacle map is built on a small
    window around the remaining GAP (the #329/#134 partial restores mean
    the gap is usually a short missing link, not the whole net).
    Board-global 0.025 is ~9M cells/layer and would exhaust memory. The
    compute limits (grid, window margin, cell budget, max attempts) are
    the RESCUE_* constants in routing_defaults. Gap LENGTH is deliberately
    unbounded (#516): the cell budget is what bounds compute — a longer
    gap gets a coarser grid, not a bigger search.
  - Always on, no flags: lives inside batch_route so the CLI and the GUI
    plugin share it (CLAUDE.md parity rule). Set KICAD_NET_RESCUE=0 to
    disable for A/B debugging.
  - Every below-nominal clearance actually routed is recorded in the
    clearance ledger, so check_drc grades at the true floor (#226).

    """Scoped fine-parameter rescue for every still-failed/partial net.

    Returns a summary dict ({'attempted', 'recovered', 'improved',
    'unchanged', 'pads_reconnected', 'widths', 'time'}) or None when there was
    nothing to rescue (or KICAD_NET_RESCUE=0).

    'widths' is {net: {'requested_mm', 'delivered_mm', and when the rescue emitted width-bearing copper, rescue_* keys describing THIS RESCUE's segments only}} for every net the
    rescue touched -- the width provenance that used to vanish: the ladder
    re-routes at the floor and reports the net `recovered` with
    `failed_single` empty, so a 0.8mm request silently shipping as 0.15mm
    copper was visible only by measuring the board (test-board run 5,
    journal [6]). Consumers: route.py exports this dict verbatim under
    summary['rescue'].

    progress_callback(i, n, "Rescue: <net>") fires per candidate net (#527 --
    this phase can dominate a step's wall clock and used to sit behind one
    static GUI message); cancel_check is honored at net and edge-attempt
    boundaries -- rescue copper is purely additive, so aborting mid-pass
    ships whatever was recovered so far.
