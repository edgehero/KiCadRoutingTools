"""
Router-in-the-loop placement repair.

Routes the board, reads the failure diagnostics (failed nets + the blocker
nets named in the router's frontier analysis), and micro-quenches ONLY the
parts that could help those routes succeed:

  - parts owning pads of the failed nets (move the endpoint out of the
    congested pocket), and
  - parts owning pads of the blocker nets (move the anchor so the blocking
    wall re-routes),

with the failed nets given extra weight in the quench cost: their airwire
length and any crossing they take part in.
High-pin-count parts are excluded from targeting (--max-target-pins) - moving
a resistor that anchors a blocker net is low-risk; dragging a 144-pin QFP to
fix one net is how placements get destroyed.

The new placement is accepted only if a real re-route improves
(failures, router iterations), otherwise it is reverted and the next round
widens the displacement cap.

    """Reduce every JSON_SUMMARY in a route.py log to one honest tally.

    route.py runs an end-of-run reconciliation pass (route.py:2144, #348)
    exactly when the first pass left failures. It self-invokes batch_route one
    level deep on the written board and prints a SECOND JSON_SUMMARY, scoped
    to the retried nets, whose failure lists route.py itself calls "the honest
    still-open set". Reading only the first summary counted every
    reconciliation recovery as a failure: the loop quenched parts anchoring
    nets that were already solved, and better() compared tallies taken at
    different points in the run.

    Per field class:

    * FAILURE STATE (failed_single / failed_multipoint / multipoint_pads_*)
      comes from the LAST summary, and is exact rather than a delta. Every net
      with a nonzero failure term is in the retry set by construction, and the
      sub-run re-derives each retried net's pad counts over ALL of that net's
      pads from the final-board union-find (route.py:1840), so the last
      summary's numbers are absolute. Summing pad counts would double-count.
    * EFFORT (total_iterations / total_vias / total_time) is SUMMED: both
      passes are work this placement cost the router, and better()'s iteration
      tiebreak should see all of it. Taking effort from the last summary would
      make a badly failing candidate look cheap, since the reconciliation pass
      only re-routes a handful of nets.
    * The #432 keys are REBUILT, because they are whole-board in the first
      summary but reconcile-subset-scoped in the sub-run's: pad_pairs_total
      keeps pass 1's whole-board denominator, pad_pairs_connected = that
      total minus the deficit of every net still open at END of run (the
      last summary's pad_pairs_open -- every pass-1 open net is in the retry
      set by construction, so absence from the sub-run's list means
      recovered). A sub-run that printed no pad-pair keys at all restores
      pass 1's, the newest numbers that exist. 'blockers' is last-wins when
      the sub-run emitted the key; when it did not, pass 1's entries are kept
      filtered to the nets still failed, so a recovered net's attribution
      dies with it and run_route never regresses to the whole-log regex.
    * Anything else is last-wins.

    Degrades to the single-summary case unchanged: no failures, or a sub-run
    that returned before printing, leaves one summary that is both the first
    and the last. Returns None when the log carries no summary at all.
