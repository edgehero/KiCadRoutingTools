    Two separate bugs made GUI-applied copper differ from the identical route
    written by the CLI text writer (#493 item 5):

    1. The GUI rounded positions to POSITION_DECIMALS (1 um) before converting,
       so any point not already on a 1 um boundary -- diagonal joins, nudged
       vias -- moved by up to 0.5 um. It rounded via SIZE and DRILL the same
       way, the same class of bug as the #362 track-width one (round(w,3) turns
       a 0.0762 fab-floor width into 0.076).
    2. `pcbnew.FromMM` TRUNCATES rather than rounds: 66.1 * 1e6 is
       66099999.99999999 in binary, so FromMM(66.1) == 66099999 -- one nm short.
       The CLI writes "66.1" as text and KiCad parses it back to 66100000, so
       the two fronts stored genuinely different integers for the same point.

    Rounding the scaled value fixes both, and nm is the board's real resolution,
    so nothing is lost.

    measured repeatedly on eth_tap: same 1159-segment set, three different
    orders across two GUI chains and the CLI. Nothing downstream should depend
    on that, but list position keeps leaking into decisions: representative
    endpoint selection, connected-group ordering, stub free ends, MST terminal
    labelling, unit distances. Each was fixed individually and another surfaced.

    Canonicalising the order ONCE, at the engine entry, closes the whole class
    instead of one consumer at a time. The key is pure geometry (layer, then the
    unordered endpoint pair, then width / size), so it is identical on both

    quantises on the way out, so the FILE is always 100% grid-exact while the
    in-memory ``pcb_data`` is not. Same board, different bits.

    That mismatch forked GUI from CLI. ``batch_route``'s final-reconcile pass
    retries incomplete nets against "the finished board", and each front had a
    different idea of what that board is: the CLI re-parses the WRITTEN file
    (grid-exact), the GUI re-invokes on the in-memory ``pcb_data`` (not). So
    ``return_results`` -- a flag that should only decide whether results are
    RETURNED -- changed what got ROUTED. Measured on eth_tap step 11, same board
    and same kwargs: reconcile ON gave CLI 3423 vs GUI 3428 segments; reconcile
    OFF gave 3423 vs 3423, bit-identical.

    Snapping is geometrically a no-op: the largest deviation measured is 0.4878
    nm, below the 0.5 nm rounding threshold, so every value lands on the SAME

    #829. A footprint's pose transforms its Edge.Cuts shapes, so moving one
    moves board geometry. But that is only a DEFECT for some of them, and the
    split is what this function computes:

    * **Structural** (`True`) -- the shape lies outside every ring the
      BOARD-LEVEL Edge.Cuts forms, so it is part of the board's own boundary.
      Moving it resizes the board, which is never a placement decision. A board
      whose outline lives entirely in footprints (Adiuvo's rp2350_fpga_eensy)
      has no board-level rings at all, so every owner is structural.
    * **Carried** (`False`) -- the shape sits inside the board outline: a
      milled relief or a window the designer PARENTED to the part precisely so
      it would travel with it. crkbd draws 184 per-LED cutout windows this way
      (see `_collect_edge_cuts_segments`), and #628 exists to keep exactly this
      class of part PLACEABLE -- it exempts a part's own milled ring from the
      edge-margin test, because without that exemption run 20's SW2, sitting
      inside its own strap slot, had 0 legal poses of 14884 (`legality.py`).
      Locking every owner would freeze the very parts that work protects.

    Deciding by containment rather than by "does it own Edge.Cuts at all" is
    the whole point: parentage is the designer's statement about which of the
    two a shape is, and the first draft of this fix read it backwards.

    make_off_board_test/_point_on_board reports every enclosed pad as off-board

    and order-only: both parse paths call this on their own ordered list and
    therefore agree, which is the whole contract between them.

    Why the FIRST occurrence keeps the bare name, when today the LAST block is
    the one the dict retains: `placement/floorplan.py` writes `'refs'` into an
    ``--emit-intent`` file the user keeps and edits, and resolves it back with
    `fnmatch.filter`. Suffixing every occurrence would make a saved intent
    naming `TP4` resolve to nothing on a file the user never touched.

    Why uuid is NOT the key: uuids are supposed to be unique, and in real
    KiCad exports they are -- but hand-made and copy-pasted boards repeat them.
    `kicad_files/cap_chain.kicad_pcb` shares one footprint uuid across C1/C2
    and another across J1/J2, so keying on it would reintroduce exactly this
    bug on a board already in the repo (`extract_groups` reached the same
    verdict for group members). A KiCad 6/7 block carries `tstamp` rather than
    `uuid` at all.

    The ordinal is issued against BOTH the file's own names and the names
    already issued, so a board that genuinely contains `TP4`, `TP4` and
    `TP4~2` cannot be handed two identical keys whatever the file order.

    Groups are the designer's own statement that a set of parts belongs

    signal (#459). Members are listed BY UUID; anything that does not resolve to
    a footprint (a zone, a graphic, a nested group) is dropped rather than
    guessed at.

    Note the group's own ``(uuid ...)`` is its identity, NOT a member -- read the
    members list explicitly rather than scooping every uuid in the block. The
    block is bounded with find_matching_paren, not a flat regex, because
    ``(members ...)`` is a nested s-expression (#113).

    No board in the in-repo corpus has a single ``(group ...)`` block, so an
    empty result is the normal case, not a parse failure.

    A uuid is supposed to be unique, and in real KiCad exports it is -- but
    hand-made and copy-pasted boards do repeat them (``cap_chain`` shares one
    uuid across two footprints, and another across two more). A uuid->ref dict
    would silently drop all but the last, so a member could resolve to the WRONG

    GUI/CLI PARITY (do not drop). pcbnew stores geometry as integer

    the TEXT parser, reading the centerline decimal straight out of the file,
    yields 223.52.

    That residue is not cosmetic. board_bounds lays out the routing grid and
    the plane-fragility cost field, so an epsilon-narrower board shifts the
    last column: measured as a 795-cell difference in the fragility field
    (217841 GUI vs 217046 CLI) on splitflap_driver, which re-priced the A*
    and left the two fronts with different GND copper -- on boards whose
    copper, zones, pads and project rules were otherwise identical.

    1e-6 mm IS KiCad's resolution, so rounding there discards only error.

    dab5c82 (the PR #613 SIGABRT fix) passed aSkipSettings=True at every
