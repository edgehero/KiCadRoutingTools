# 250 wins on BOTH axes (-6 nets; -15 DRC over 8 boards better / 1 worse) and lands
# exactly on v0.21.2's own numbers -- paired against the released engine it is
# W0/L0/T69 with identical DRC. This ONE constant accounted for 100% of main's
# regression against 0.21.2; nothing else in the 21 commits since the tag moved it.
#
# 25 and 50 are worse than either end: a genuine interior WORST, not a plateau.
# Do not "split the difference" here without measuring.
#
# Why #663 concluded the opposite: its 5 came from a 4-point sweep on ONE board
# (orangecrab), and that board is an outlier for this knob -- a single-board
# optimum that did not generalize. Do not re-derive this from one board.
#
# Two follow-ups measured and RETIRED, so they need not be re-litigated:
#   * Coherence: making the oracle-weld/plane sub-configs follow this constant
#     instead of their hardcoded 250 moved nothing (94/59 vs 95/58). The VALUE
#     mattered; the mixed state did not.
#   * Diff pairs at base/10 (the theory that a coupled pair cannot pay an
#     off-axis tax): +6 nets and +52 real DRC vs plain 250, over 5 boards worse
#     / 1 better. Refuted; the divisor was dropped.
# 250 is a compromise: 5000 (5x a move) reproduced human H/V lane style but
# starved routability on dense boards (sets 6-11 A/B: +104 incomplete nets,
# kbic65 98.9%->15.1%, route.py ~2x slower); the old 50 (~5% of a move) was
# functionally inert. 250 (~25% of a move) keeps a real lane nudge without the
# cost-5000 wall that made short diagonal diode/matrix hops unroutable.
