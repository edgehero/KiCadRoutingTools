"""Read-once cache of the KICAD_* environment knobs.

The engine's experimental/diagnostic knobs were read with ``os.environ.get``
at their point of use -- some per net, per leg, or per congestion sample --
which both hammers the environ dict from hot paths and scatters the knob
inventory across a dozen modules. Every knob is read ONCE here, at import,
and stored as a plain module attribute; call sites read the attribute.

Semantics: a knob is its value at process start (first import). Harnesses that
pass knobs to CHILD processes via the environment are unaffected -- the child
re-reads at its own import (see memory: env vars must be EXPORTED for
subprocesses, an inline prefix misses children). Code that mutates
``os.environ`` mid-process and needs THIS process to see it calls
``refresh()`` afterwards.

Each attribute preserves the exact parse semantics its call site had (truthy
vs '1' vs default-on off-switch vs opt-in set) -- flipping one to a stricter
parse silently disables someone's recorded workflow. Argparse ``default=os.
environ.get(...)`` sites (route.py --ripup-* ) deliberately stay in place:
they are startup-once and self-document the override in --help.
