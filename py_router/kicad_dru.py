"""Per-layer clearance rules from a board's custom design rules (#498).

KiCad stores layer-scoped clearance requirements in ``<project>.kicad_dru``
(Board Setup -> Custom Rules) -- netclasses cannot express them (a net spans
layers but carries one clearance). This module reads the PARSABLE SUBSET of
those rules into a ``{layer_name: clearance_mm}`` map the router and checkers
consume with REPLACEMENT semantics: on a ruled layer the rule value replaces
the net/class-resolved pair clearance (KiCad's own precedence -- custom rules
outrank netclasses and may tighten OR relax), while unruled layers keep the
existing resolution. The map is the board's own spec, so it outranks
``--clearance`` too; only the fab tier's physical floor pins it up.

Subset honored (anything else is skipped with a note -- mis-modeling KiCad's
expression engine would silently manufacture wrong clearances):
  - ``(constraint clearance (min <val>))`` rules whose scope is pure layers:
      * a ``(layer <name>|outer|inner)`` clause, and/or
      * a ``(condition "A.onLayer('X') || B.onLayer('Y') ...")`` expression
        containing ONLY onLayer terms joined by ``||``
  - a rule with NO scope applies to every copper layer (KiCad semantics)
  - later rules override earlier ones per layer (KiCad evaluates last-to-
    first, first match wins)
  - ``(severity ignore)`` rules are skipped

THE SECOND CHANNEL, and it is not the same shape. TRACK-SCOPED rules
(``A.Type=='track' && B.Type=='track'`` plus one net-class term) cannot be a
layer map at all -- they are a predicate on a PAIR of nets -- so they parse out
of the same single pass as a ``TrackRule`` list and are **raise-only** over an
already-resolved pair value, never a replacement. Two resolvers consume them,
and the difference matters when reading a number back:

  * ``track_pair_clearance`` is PAIR-EXACT and is what a grader or a
    geometry gate that knows both nets must use (check_drc's seg-seg site,
    the fanout-clearance connector gate).
  * ``effective_track_clearances`` OVER-APPROXIMATES per obstacle net,
    because the router's obstacle map is shared across the routed set and
    has no room for a per-pair value. Router output therefore always grades
    clean, never the reverse.

A track rule binds tracks and nothing else: no pad, no via, no zone. That is
KiCad's own ``Type=='track'`` and it is why the pad channels above are
untouched by this half of the module.

HISTORICAL NOTE -- the `#549` label, and why this module no longer carries it.

Commits dated 2026-08-02 label four unrelated topics `#549 A-1`, `#549 A-2`,
`#549 B-1`, `#549 B-2`; comments added `#549 C3` and `#549 D`. That label was a
session work plan, NOT GitHub #549 -- which was CLOSED on 2026-08-01 by PR #555
("Floorplan intent graded") and is about the placement skill. Its sub-letters
collide with each other too: `A-1` marks both this parser and the
strict-fragment view, `A-2` marks both this channel going live and the planner
riding that view, `B-1` marks both the corridor seeds and the oracle summary
check. The map, for `git log`:

  fa685741  #549 A-1  -> .kicad_dru TRACK channel, parse (inert)    -> #735
  8856c0e4  #549 A-2  -> .kicad_dru TRACK channel, live             -> #735
  972131a4  #549      -> TRACK channel, octolinear smoothing        -> #735
  56dea0cf  #549 A-1  -> strict-fragment view (check_connected)
  a29d3f88  #549 A-2  -> planner rides the strict view              -> #578
  b0dfaeb2  #549 B-1  -> corridor seeds (inert)      REMOVED f93bd946 (#575)
  ab650b93  #549 B-2  -> --corridor-nets live        REMOVED f93bd946 (#575)
  b9a527fd  #549 B-1  -> end-of-run oracle summary check

The floorplan-intent, routability and skill families KEEP `#549`: those really
are GitHub #549 (adc17a39, 0095aee9, dfdfe7c8, 7bef8b90, 4af27f51, all in
PR #555). Retagging them would have removed the one accurate pointer.
