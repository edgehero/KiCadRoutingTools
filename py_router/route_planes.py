"""
Copper Plane Generator - Creates copper pour zones (the #562 "bare pour").

Creates a solid copper zone on a specified layer, plus optional via
features: thermal via arrays under exposed pads (#487), area stitching
vias (--stitch-vias), and GND return vias (--add-gnd-vias). It places NO
per-pad tap vias and draws NO traces (#562): every pad that needs a via to
reach the plane is deferred to the route step, whose pour-launch welds it
into the fill and whose in-run plane finalize taps whatever the fill
cannot reach. Run route.py over all nets (plane nets included) after this
and grade THAT board, not the bare pour.

Usage:
    python py_router/route_planes.py input.kicad_pcb output.kicad_pcb --nets GND --plane-layers B.Cu

    Find the closest valid position for a via near a pad.

    Uses spiral search outward from pad center, checking clearances.
    If routing_obstacles is provided, also verifies that A* can route from the via to the pad.

    Args:
        pad: Target pad
        obstacles: Via obstacle map
        coord: Grid coordinate converter
        max_search_radius: Maximum distance to search
        routing_obstacles: Optional routing obstacle map for routability check
        config: Optional routing config (required if routing_obstacles provided)
        pad_layer: Layer for routing (required if routing_obstacles provided)
        net_id: Net ID for routing (required if routing_obstacles provided)
        verbose: Print debug output on failure
        failed_route_positions: Optional set of (gx, gy) positions where routing previously
            failed. Positions within 2x via-size will be skipped. Failed positions from
            this call will be added to the set.
        pending_pads: Optional list of pad_info dicts for pads that still need vias.
            Via positions too close to these pads' boundaries will be skipped to ensure
            routes can still reach them.
        position_filter: Optional (x, y) -> bool predicate; positions failing it are
            skipped. Used to keep a plane-tap via INSIDE its net's zone polygon on a
            Voronoi-shared layer (issue #287) -- a via in the inter-cell gap reaches
            no fill and leaves the pad floating while reporting success.
        position_preference: Optional (x, y) -> bool SOFT ranking (never excludes):
            candidates it approves are tried first (nearest-preferred wins over
            nearest); with a routability check, the multi-source A* seeds the
            preferred candidates alone first and falls back to the full set.
            Used to prefer via sites on the PREDICTED main zone-fill component,
            so stitching vias stop landing in clearance-carved pockets that the
            plane repair step must strap later.

    Returns:

    Re-parses the written output and, for each plane net, uses

    joined to that net's plane copper. This catches two classes of failure the
    via-placement counters miss:

      * #89: a stitching via was placed/reused but is not electrically joined
        to the net's zone (so the via-placement success counter overcounts).
      * #107: on a multi-net Voronoi layer, a through-hole pad sits inside the
        OTHER net's Voronoi cell, so it never gets a via and is never counted,
        yet its own net's zone does not cover it -> geometrically disconnected.

    Returns a dict mapping net_id -> {name, layer, total, connected, failed,
    disconnected_pads}. Returns {} (and prints a warning) if the check could

    Nets stitched: exactly the requested plane nets that own >= 2 of the
    requested plane layers (deliberately no CLI selection). Every site --
    fence or lattice -- is gated twice:

    - Predicted fill (ZoneFillModel over this run's zone geometry, or a kept
      existing zone): the via disk PLUS its clearance pocket PLUS a
      min_thickness ring must lie inside the MAIN fill component on >= 2 of

      min_thickness locally and never taps a fill island.
    - The same via obstacle map pad taps use (foreign copper at cross-class

      plus block_via_position between batch placements -- so the lattice
      cannot reintroduce the #274/#125/#271 same-net via-spacing class.

    coverage-satisfied and skipped (the via-reuse rule); a blocked site is

    Create copper pour zones for multiple nets (#562 bare pour), plus optional via
    features (thermal arrays #487, stitch vias #485); per-pad tap vias are deferred
    to the route step.

    Args:
        net_names: List of net names to process (e.g., ['GND', 'VCC'])
        plane_layers: List of layers for each net (e.g., ['In1.Cu', 'In2.Cu'])
        plane_proximity_radius: Radius around other nets' vias for proximity cost (mm).
        plane_proximity_cost: Maximum proximity cost around other nets' vias (mm equivalent).
        plane_track_via_clearance: Clearance from track center to other nets' via centers (mm).
            MST routes will avoid regions within this distance of other nets' vias to
            leave room for polygon fill.
        board_edge_clearance: Clearance from board edge for zone polygons (mm).
        voronoi_seed_interval: Sample interval for Voronoi seed points along routes (mm).
        plane_max_iterations: Max A* iterations for routing plane connections.
        same_net_pad_clearance: Edge-to-edge clearance (mm) between stitching vias and
            same-net pads. -1 (default) allows via-in-pad placement. Any value >= 0
            forces vias to be placed outside same-net pads with that much clearance.
        skip_existing_zones: When True, if a zone already exists on the target layer
            for the same net (in either the input file or the provided pcb_data), do
            not create another one - just place stitching vias to the existing zone.
            When False (CLI default), an existing zone on the target layer for the
            same net is replaced.
        progress_callback: Optional callable(current, total, label) invoked at
            phase milestones and per-pad during via placement, mirroring
            batch_route's callback (issue #364). (0, 0, label) marks an
            indeterminate phase. Called from whatever thread runs the engine;
            GUI callers must marshal to the UI thread themselves.
        cancel_check: Optional callable returning True to abort. Checked at
            net and pad boundaries; on cancel the function returns early with
            the work done so far -- a cancelling caller should DISCARD the
            partial results (the GUI does).

    Returns:
        return_results=False (CLI): the 3-tuple
            (total_vias_placed, total_traces_added, total_pads_needing_vias).
        return_results=True (GUI): the 10-tuple
            (total_vias_placed, total_traces_added, total_pads_needing_vias,
             new_vias, new_segments, new_zones, total_failed_pads,
             ripped_net_ids, reconnect_swap_data (#484 H3),
             reconnect_strips (#508)).
        Every early/error exit returns the caller-appropriate shape via
