"""Shared post-route cleanup pipeline (issue #319 restructure).

One ordered pipeline used by BOTH routing fronts (route.py single-ended,
route_diff.py diff-pair), so the pass list, the ordering constraints, and the
strip-list plumbing exist exactly once instead of being hand-mirrored.

The contract -- uniform, with NO exceptions:

  * every pass MUTATES ``pcb_data`` in place, so at any point in (and after)
    the pipeline ``pcb_data`` IS the board that will be written, modulo the
    swap vias / stub layer modifications the writer applies to the file text
    separately;
  * removed copper that this run routed (present in a ``results`` entry) is
    dropped from ``results`` -- the write-list -- in place;
  * removed copper that came from the INPUT FILE is collected in
    ``CleanupOutcome.input_strip_segments`` for the writer to delete from its
    verbatim copy of the input;
  * subtractive passes must not manufacture soft joints (they run with the
    ``_restore_soft_joint_bridges`` guard), and ``close_soft_joints`` runs
    LAST so no later pass can re-delete the bridges it adds. The
    ``no_more_copper_removal`` flag makes that ordering an enforced invariant
    instead of a comment.

``KICAD_BOARD_LEDGER=1`` audits the contract at the end of a run (see
``verify_board_file_parity``): per in-scope net, the copper in ``pcb_data``
and the copper the writer will produce (original input copper - strips +
emitted results) must be identical.

    """Run the post-route cleanup passes in their one canonical order.

    Order and rationale (each pass's own docstring has the full story):
      1. snap_stub_gaps        -- additive; extend a stub that stopped a
                                  fraction short of same-net copper (#84).
      2. drop_phantom_copper   -- reconcile the write-list against the board so
                                  ripped-but-unrestored copper never ships (#133).
         -> ``freeze_hook`` fires HERE: the board is now exactly what routing
            committed, before any cleanup pass trims it. route.py freezes its
            stale-input-strip reference snapshot at this point (#220/#284),
            which is what makes the strip immune to the passes below.
      3. prune_grazing_segments -- drop a redundant foreign-grazing segment
                                  (#224); before the cycle/dead-end passes so
                                  the stub it leaves gets collapsed.
      4. nudge_grazing_octolinear / 5. nudge_grazing_microshift /
      6. nudge_grazing_vias    -- re-bend / micro-shift load-bearing grazes the
                                  prune must keep (#224/#276/#280).
      7. prune_redundant_cycles -- per-net tree invariant (RAM_A9 loops).
      8. sweep_dead_ends       -- trim dead-end spurs and unsupported vias.
      9. neck_wide_segments_grazing_pads -- width-only fix for wide power
                                  trunks overlapping a fine-pitch foreign pad.
      9b. smooth_octolinear_chains -- #536: collapse staircase micro-jogs
                                  into diagonal+axis shortcuts. Front default
                                  via the ``smooth`` kwarg (route step ON,
                                  diff pairs / plane round-trip OFF);
                                  KICAD_SMOOTH_ROUTE=1/0 overrides. Last
                                  shape pass, still before close (it removes
                                  copper); skips protected / impedance nets
                                  (_smooth_skip_net_ids).
     10. close_soft_joints     -- LAST copper step (#319 ordering): bridge any
                                  remaining same-net soft joint. The
                                  subtractive passes above run with the
                                  _restore_soft_joint_bridges guard, so every
                                  joint close sees is router-born, never one a
                                  cleanup pass manufactured.

    ``label`` prefixes the progress prints (e.g. "Diff-pair "). The pass
    switches exist for front parity, not taste:
      * route_diff.py historically runs without snap/phantom/neck; flipping
        them on there is a deliberate behavior change, not a side effect of
        this refactor (octolinear WAS flipped on for #318: the re-bend keeps
        anchors coincident and clears() includes the partner net);
      * the plane fronts' file-round-trip (clean_plane_copper) must keep
        ``via_nudge`` OFF -- it re-parses the written board, so every via is
        an "input" via whose in-place geometry move the segment-level
        write-back cannot express (#280/#281: input-via moves silently revert
        in writers, stranding the dragged segment endpoints);
      * ``microshift_max_shift`` defaults to grid_step/2 (sub-grid
        quantization); the plane repair path passes a full grid_step (#308 --
        its tracks are on-grid against off-grid holes).

    ``progress_callback(0, 0, "<label>Cleanup: <pass>...")`` fires before
    each pass (#527: the whole pipeline used to run behind whatever message
    the previous phase left on screen -- minutes of apparent hang on dense
    boards). No cancel hook by design: the passes maintain board/write-list
    invariants pairwise, and aborting between them ships a half-reconciled
    ledger.

    Returns a CleanupOutcome; input-file removals from every pass are merged
    into ``input_strip_segments`` in pass order.

    ``keep_input_copper`` makes INPUT-FILE copper read-only for every
    subtractive/rewriting pass: it still anchors connectivity, degree and
    grazing models, but is never removed, split, or re-bent — for chained
    flows whose earlier stages author copper (escape stubs, hand-authored
    routes) that a later stage must still see verbatim. This-run copper is
    cleaned normally, and the strip lists then stay empty by construction.
    Do NOT set it on the plane fronts' file-round-trip (results=[] makes
    every segment read as input and would freeze all plane copper).
