    endpoint coincides with it on its layer -- that also does not land on a pad,
    a via, or the interior of another same-net segment (a T-junction). Such an
    endpoint connects nothing, so the segment is dead copper: a tap tail left
    when the branch it fed was superseded, a stub a net routed away from, a
    fragment orphaned by rip-and-reroute. Removing it can never disconnect the
    net (the other end stays joined to the rest), and it exposes the next
    segment of a spur chain, so this iterates to a fixpoint.

    This is the whole-net post-route dead-end trim (#84): it removes dead ends of
    any length and unwinds whole spurs (the per-commit ``collapse_appendices``
    short-spur pass it superseded was removed as redundant in #148).

        vias, pads: same-net vias / pads that anchor an endpoint.
        tol: proximity tolerance (mm) for the on-segment / coincidence tests.

# Corner-graze terminal joint web (issue #416)
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The A* terminal cell is grid-quantised: a track can terminate so its round END
# CAP overlaps only the CORNER of its target SMD pad. The joint is electrically
# connected and DRC-clean (the caps touch), so no gap-closer fires -- but the
# only copper joining track to pad is a thin corner sliver, narrower than the
# board's minimum track width (KiCad's connection_width class): a fab hazard, the
# joint can etch open. This is NOT an open, so it is a natural extension of
# close_soft_joints, which already firms up fragile same-net joints with a short
# added connector -- here the second endpoint is a PAD rather than a dangle, and
# the connector adds a PARALLEL wide copper path into the pad interior so the
# thin corner sliver is no longer the sole connection.
#
# The min-web test is KiCad's own: union the joint's copper and erode by floor/2;
# a web >= floor survives connected, a sub-floor web splits/vanishes
# (tests/stress/classify_connection_width.py). Specialised to a terminal (a
# round-capped segment meeting a convex pad rectangle) that erosion has an exact
# closed form -- no shapely, so it runs in the KiCad-python GUI front too: in the
# pad's axis-aligned local frame the eroded track is the segment buffered by
# (r - e) (r = track half-width, e = floor/2, and r >= e because floor is the
# thinnest track on the board), and the eroded pad is the rectangle shrunk by e.
# The joint survives IFF that buffered segment reaches the shrunk rectangle, i.e.
#   dist(segment, pad_rect_shrunk_by_e) <= r - e.
# When it does not, close_soft_joints adds a short connector from the endpoint to
# the nearest point INSIDE the shrunk rectangle: the connector's far cap then
# lands deep enough that its own overlap with the pad is a full floor-width band,
# a parallel path that survives the erosion. The connector is clearance-checked
# against every foreign object and the board edge, and lands on the SAME net's
# own pad, so it can never disconnect or short anything.

    pad), which is a SUBSET of the erosion-OF-union KiCad actually measures, so
    it never MISSES a real neck but it over-reports (a perpendicular shallow
    entry crossing an edge far from a corner is fine yet trips it). Callers use
    it as a cheap reject and CONFIRM a positive with ``terminal_web_neck_exact``
    (exact shapely erosion, matches kicad-cli's connection_width). Kept separate
    so the confirm runs only on the handful of candidates, and so a shapely-less
    environment still has a safe (conservative) fallback.

    """In-loop stub-debris trim: the moment a net's route COMMITS, prune
    the branches of its own pre-existing stub tree the route left unused
    -- and any via those branches leave DANGLING (same-net copper on <=1
    layer of its span).

    Timing is the point (#622): sweep_dead_ends does this board-wide but
    runs in the post-route cleanup, AFTER every net has routed -- so an
    orphaned fanout tail, and worse its via barrel (which blocks every
    layer), holds its space against ALL later nets and is only swept
    when nobody can use it anymore. This runs between
    add_route_to_pcb_data and update_net_obstacles_after_routing, so the
    freed cells never enter the recomputed obstacle cache and the very
    NEXT net can route through them. Measured motive (allwinner DDR
    microscope): a member attaching at its ball orphans its escape stub;
    the tail plus the ball via then blocked the under-field channels its
    own siblings needed.

    Safety mirrors sweep_dead_ends: per-segment connectivity-validated
    prune (_safe_prune_net), soft-joint restore, graphics and LOCKED
    copper anchored (never removed), and via drops verified by a whole-
    net before/after connectivity check (locked vias exempt). Mutates
    pcb_data and the result's write-lists in place; input copper removed
    here leaves the written output via the #220/#284 stale-input strip,
    whose reference snapshot freezes later (at cleanup); in
    --keep-input-copper runs (config._keep_input_copper) input copper is
    read-only. Returns (segments_removed, vias_removed).

    `vias_only` runs the DANGLING-VIA pass WITHOUT the stub prune. It is NOT
    USED, and the reason is worth keeping: it was written to let MULTIPOINT nets
    trim their dangling vias, on the argument that the exemption protects stubs
    (Phase-3 landing sites) and a via is not one. THAT ARGUMENT IS WRONG and the
    corpus said so -- on glasgow_revC, one pass from an identical input went from
    2 open nets to 5, and the log shows one net losing 8 vias at once. On a
    multipoint net the via IS where a later Phase-3 tap lands, and
    `_via_support_layers(...) <= 1` measures support BEFORE those taps arrive --
    so a via that is legitimately half-connected at trim time reads as dangling.
    The exemption is load-bearing exactly as the original author wrote it.

    The DRC symptom that motivated this is real and still open (see below); it
    needs a remedy that runs AFTER Phase 3, not an in-loop trim.

    Measured on glasgow_revC: a multipoint net kept a via carrying copper on
    B.Cu only, 50 um from its own functional via, against a 250 um hole-to-hole
    rule -- a real DRC violation. The board-wide sweep does not catch it either:
    sweep_dead_ends never calls _via_support_layers and never removes input
    vias, which is the whole reason this in-loop pass exists.

    `swap_vias` is the run's stub-layer-swap via list (`state.all_swap_vias`),
    and it MUST be passed or this pass ships DRC violations. The output writer
    emits vias from TWO sources -- each result's `new_vias`, and that list --
    and a swap via also lives in `pcb_data.vias`. Dropping it from `pcb_data`
    alone frees its cells in the obstacle map while the writer still emits it
    from `all_swap_vias`: a later net routes through the vacated space and the
    via reappears beside the new track. Measured on tinytapeout_qfn: 10 of 34
    swap vias were freed here and every one was still written (a "ghost" -- in
    the file, absent from the board model), producing 12 Via<->Seg clearance
    violations on a board that graded clean before this pass existed. The
    `vias_to_remove` writer channel cannot help: it strips vias from the
    verbatim copy of the INPUT file, so it never reaches copper this run
    appended. The list is filtered IN PLACE because the writer holds the same
    list object.

    Pattern -- ``A --s1--> B --s2--> C`` on ONE net, where:
      * ``B`` is a vertex touched by ONLY ``s1`` and ``s2`` (no via/pad there),
      * ``s1``/``s2`` are ROUTED short jogs (a grid->float bridge, not a real run),
      * ``A`` and ``C`` are each anchored to the net's MAIN path (another same-net
        segment / via / pad),
      * ``A`` and ``C`` already OVERLAP in copper -- ``dist(A,C) < (wA+wC)/2`` -- so
        the pair is *physically connected already*; welding only FORMALISES that
        overlap, it never invents a new connection, and
      * ``s1`` or ``s2`` grazes FOREIGN copper below clearance (the reason to act).

    route_diff's hybrid leaves this when a terminal leg's A* near-end lands ~half a
    grid step off the coupled-middle end: ``_path_to_segments_vias`` bridges the gap
    with an out-and-back jog that pokes at the partner track.
    :func:`prune_grazing_segments` detects that graze but its strict connectivity
    gate (#322) refuses to drop the jog -- the surviving ``A~C`` overlap is
    non-coincident, so the strict graph sees the removal as a split -- and necking
    can't clear it (already at the fab floor). Here we instead WELD ``C`` onto ``A``
    (a ``< (wA+wC)/2`` move, i.e. entirely inside the copper the pair already
    shares), re-anchor ``C``'s main segment to ``A``, and delete ``s1``/``s2`` --
    but ONLY when the re-anchored segment still clears foreign copper and the net's
    connectivity is no worse. The join is coincident afterwards, so the strict gate
    is satisfied and the graze is gone. Widths/positions of unrelated copper are
    untouched, and a weld that can't provably clear foreign copper is skipped (the
    graze then ships honestly), so this cannot manufacture a new violation.

    With ``check_foreign_segments`` (diff-pair cleanup, #215) a segment that grazes
    another NET's track below clearance is also a candidate -- e.g. a redundant P
    connector overshoot that pokes within clearance of the partner N track. Same
    connectivity gate, so a load-bearing track (the partner's own through-run) is
    kept; only the redundant overshoot is dropped.

    The router lays a terminal/tap segment toward its own pad/via through the
    obstacle-exempt endpoint region, so at tight connector / fine pad pitch it can
    sit sub-clearance to a NEIGHBOURING foreign pad -- a route.py launch jog, a
    repair_planes tap. `_neck_terminal_grazes` only narrows such a
    segment and is floored at the fab track minimum, so a sub-floor graze survives
    to DRC. But these grazing segments are frequently a REDUNDANT detour/appendix:
    the adjacent (wider) copper already overlaps enough to carry the connection, so
    dropping the grazing segment leaves the net fully connected and removes the
    violation outright (e.g. ottercast Net-(R81-Pad1)'s tab poking at the C3 pad).

    A candidate is removed only when the AUTHORITATIVE copper-width-aware
    check_net_connectivity confirms the net is no worse connected without it -- a
    load-bearing graze (e.g. a plane tap that is a pad's sole connection to the
    pour) is kept and left for DRC. Zoned nets are checked WITH their pour, so a
    tap that the fill makes redundant can still be dropped. Mirrors

    POURS the moving copper carves are deliberately not consulted -- the
    same pour-blind convention routing follows; the plane finalize /
    kicad-oracle recheck downstream owns that damage (see the comment at
    the clears() block). dry_run=True measures without mutating anything --
    the #536 "is it worth it on OUR output" instrument. Soft costs are
    deliberately not consulted (the router's corridors are a routing-time
    concept); callers gate this to the final chain step -- see

    # it: the in-run plane finalize / kicad-oracle recheck runs AFTER this

    pad can therefore lose that pad's credit in the MODEL while the board is
    unchanged -- a phantom open that the downstream repair passes would then
    "fix" by adding copper nobody needed.

    So a vertex is droppable only when every same-net pad covering it also
    covers a vertex that SURVIVES. Re-solved to a fixpoint (each round forces
    the orphaned vertices back and recollapses) because forcing one vertex back
    changes which line the others are measured against.

    ``pad_cover`` is a callable (x, y) -> frozenset of pad ids, NOT a
    precomputed list: it is consulted only once the cheap geometric pass has
    found something to merge. Most chains on a board have no collinear joint at
    all, and pad_cover is the expensive part (a scan of the net's pads per
    vertex), so paying it per chain up front made the pass several times
    dearer for no result. None disables the custody rule entirely.

    """Join collinear same-net/same-layer/same-width track pieces (#811).

    ``simplify_path`` collapses collinear points at PATH level, before copper is
    emitted. Everything after that can re-introduce a collinear joint, and until
    this pass nothing joined them back, so a dead-straight track shipped as two
    or three separate segments. Measured sources, per-pass instrumented on
    splitflap_driver (25 joints at the end of the pipeline):

      * ``smooth_octolinear_chains``  +10 -- the elbow it substitutes lands
        collinear with the neighbouring kept segment, a joint it never revisits;
      * route emission                 11 -- terminal exact-pad stubs that
        ``_merge_terminal_to_exact`` declined (the merged span would graze), and
        multipoint links whose paths are simplified INDEPENDENTLY then joined;
      * ``prune_redundant_cycles``     +4 -- dropping a cycle branch turns a
        degree-3 junction into a collinear degree-2 joint;
      * ``close_soft_joints``          +1 -- its bridge is collinear with the
        two ends it joins, by construction.

    Denser boards carry proportionally more: kicad_files/routed_output.kicad_pcb
    ships 322 removable segments of 1701 (19%), with 78 straight tracks broken
    into three pieces.

    THE PASS MOVES NO COPPER. A joint is merged only when the shared vertex lies
    within ``max_deviation`` of the line joining its neighbours AND the two legs
    point the same way, so the merged capsule is the union of the originals. The
    default 1e-6 mm is KiCad's own internal unit (1 nm) -- below the board's
    coordinate resolution, so the copper polygon is unchanged, not merely close.
    That is not a guess at what is safe: the real population is bit-exactly
    collinear (deviation <= 1e-12 mm on every one of 322/25/81 joints measured
    across three boards), while genuine sub-degree KINKS sit at 1.2-2.4 um and
    are correctly left alone. Because nothing moves, this pass needs none of the
    clearance/connectivity guards the shape passes carry, and it is the one
    copper pass that may run AFTER ``close_soft_joints``: merging a bridge into
    its neighbours keeps the joint closed rather than reopening it.

    Merge eligibility comes from smooth_octolinear_chains' anchor model, with
    one deliberate difference. A vertex is interior only when the two chain
    segments are the ONLY same-net copper touching it (any layer, any width)
    and no same-net via sits there -- our connectivity model joins segments and
    barrels at ENDPOINTS, so merging across a tee or a barrel would strand that
    branch in the model even though the board is unchanged. A same-net PAD over
    the vertex does NOT veto the merge, because this pass keeps the copper the
    pad touches; instead the pad's custody is carried per vertex and a vertex is
    dropped only when every pad covering it also covers a surviving vertex (see
    _collapse_collinear_vertices). That distinction matters: pad-covered joints
    are 15 of the 25 on splitflap_driver -- the terminal exact-pad stubs that
    are the issue's own screenshot -- so vetoing them outright would have left
    the reported case unfixed. KiCad-locked segments are never merged at all:
    the user pinned that exact track.

    Overlapping (rather than merely touching) same-net copper is a different
    defect with a different fix -- see issue #606; this pass does not address it.

    """Micro-shift copper that still grazes after prune / re-bend / neck (#276).

    Complements nudge_grazing_octolinear, which keeps a jog's anchor endpoints
    FIXED -- useless when the closest approach IS an anchor (a terminal joint
    vertex 8-16um inside the required clearance, e.g. ottercast C58.1) or when
    the only fix is a tiny sideways bow mid-segment (butterstick CATG vs a
    foreign via). Two moves, each by the measured shortfall plus a hair -- the
    minimum copper displacement that restores clearance:

      * VERTEX shift (closest approach at/near an endpoint): move that endpoint
        -- and every same-net same-layer segment sharing the exact vertex --
        directly away from the offender. Terminal joints have slack: their
        endpoint sits inside an adjoining stub's copper body, so a tiny slide
        keeps the copper-overlap join; the connectivity gate proves it. A
        vertex carrying a via never moves (layer-stack alignment).
      * BOW (closest approach mid-segment): split at the approach and offset a
        short middle section perpendicular, away from the offender.

    Every candidate is verified to clear ALL foreign copper (pad/track/via)
    and the board edge at its own width, and to not worsen the net's
    connectivity, before it replaces the original geometry -- the pass can only
    remove a graze, never introduce one or disconnect a net. A graze that no
    candidate clears is left for the DRC report.

    ``max_shift`` HARD-caps how far any copper may move (callers pass half the
    routing grid step): this pass is strictly a micrometre-scale touch-up, so a
    graze needing more than that is genuinely mis-routed and must stay visible
    in the DRC report rather than be papered over with a wild move.

    Returns (segments_changed, nets_changed, original_segments_to_remove,
    added_segments) -- same contract as nudge_grazing_octolinear.

    Two vias snapped to the routing grid can land a few µm inside clearance
    (usb_sniffer: a GND plane-stitch via 7µm short of a signal via). Tracks
    have the microshift pass; vias had nothing -- the microshift deliberately
    never moves a via vertex. This pass moves the VIA ALONE (no segment is
    touched) by the measured shortfall plus a hair, away from the worst
    offender: the attached track ends stay buried deep inside the via body
    (the move is far below the via radius), so KiCad's copper-overlap
    connectivity is untouched, and check_net_connectivity joins a segment end
    to a via within via_size/4 -- exactly the move cap.

    Guardrails (why this is safe where the removed in-routing nudge_grazes was
    not, #147/#70/#130):
      * post-route and via-only -- nothing is ripped, re-routed, or dragged;
      * the move is hard-capped at min(``max_shift``, via_size/4) (callers
        pass grid_step/2): a via needing more is genuinely mis-placed and
        stays visible in DRC;
      * a candidate is committed only when the via clears EVERY foreign
        object at its new spot (segment/via/pad body, drill hole-to-hole
        incl. same-net, via COPPER to an unplated NPTH hole at the pad's
        clearance (#441), and the board edge) -- strictly fewer grazes, never
        a new one;
      * connectivity is re-checked per net and the move reverted if worse.

    Only vias CREATED BY THIS RUN may move: the writers re-emit this run's
    new vias but keep the input file's text for pre-existing ones, so moving
    an input via would silently revert in the output. Candidates come from
    ``results[*]['new_vias']`` (or ``allowed_via_ids``, a set of id(via), for
    the plane wrapper whose results list is empty).

    Returns (vias_moved, nets_changed, moves) with moves =
    [(net_id, old_x, old_y, new_x, new_y)] so plane-script callers can mirror
    the new position into their via write-list dicts.

    Same-net copper is not an obstacle, so the per-net via-placement map's
    hole-to-hole block (block_via_position) never fires between two same-net vias.
    Independently-routed plane taps / region joins can therefore drop two same-net
    vias a single grid cell apart, overlapping their drills -- e.g. hackrf VCC at
    decoupling cap C133.1: two F.Cu-B.Cu through-vias 0.05mm apart, a check_drc
    via-drill-hole overlap KiCad net-unifies and hides. A via must respect
    hole-to-hole ALWAYS, even same-net; when a same-net via already sits within
    range, reuse it instead of shipping an overlapping duplicate.

    A NEW via is dropped in favor of a survivor of the SAME net when
        center_dist < drill_a/2 + drill_b/2 + hole_to_hole_clearance
    AND the survivor's layer span covers the dropped via's span (so connectivity is

    earlier-kept new via. Segment endpoints coincident with a dropped via are moved

    and their Segment-level removals/additions are mirrored back into the dict list
    by coordinate signature.

    The plane scripts have no other cleanup of their own copper (route.py excludes
    the plane nets), so this is their only chance to drop bad taps:
      * grazing prune with ``check_foreign_segments`` -- a tap laid through the
        obstacle-exempt endpoint region can sit sub-clearance to a neighbouring
        signal TRACK, not just a pad/via (glasgow +3V3 tap grazing the Y2 track);
      * dead-end sweep -- a superseded/failed reuse-tap (the fill-aware re-check
        force-via path leaves the abandoned tap copper behind) is a dangling
        appendix that never reaches the plane.
    Both are connectivity-gated WITH the pour (check_net_connectivity sees the
    zones), so a load-bearing tap that actually carries a pad to the plane is kept
    and only genuinely redundant/dead copper goes.
