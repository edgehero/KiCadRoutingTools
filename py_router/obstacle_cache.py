# add/remove of a cache object against the WORKING map (identified by id(); set
# by build_working_obstacle_map) is recorded with its call site. The invariant

# serial's adds - removes == 1 for objects still resident in the cache dict and
# == 0 for replaced/dropped ones. obstacle_ledger_report() prints the serials
# (and sites) that violate it - naming the exact leaking interleaving that the
# whole-map KICAD_OBSTACLE_AUDIT diff can only total. Raw (non-cache) list ops
# on the working map are accounted separately by get_stats() deltas per site.
