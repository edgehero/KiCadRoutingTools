"""Compatibility shim: this tool moved to ``py_placer/`` in the #522 reorg.

The placement family was split out of ``py_router/`` into ``py_placer/``, but
**297 recorded stress chains across 172 boards still invoke this path**
(``redo_commands.sh`` is a replay manifest -- it records the command line that
was run, verbatim, and those recordings are not ours to rewrite). Without this
file every one of those chains dies mid-replay:

    python3: can't open file '.../py_router/place_fanout_clearance.py'
      -> 0.50s  exit 2
      (non-check command failed)

and the board is abandoned with no final artifact, which a corpus A/B then
reads as 48 boards that "failed to complete" -- a path break wearing the
costume of a routing regression. Measured exactly that way on sets 1-10:
placement produced 100 chain-complete boards against main's 147, entirely from
this one missing path.

Deliberately a forwarder rather than a copy: there is ONE implementation, in
``py_placer/place_fanout_clearance.py``. ``run_name='__main__'`` so its
``if __name__ == '__main__'`` block runs and argv/exit codes pass straight
through, and ``py_placer`` goes on ``sys.path`` first so the real module's own
``import _path`` bootstrap resolves.

Do not delete this without rewriting the recorded corpus -- and note that
rewriting it would make those chains replayable ONLY on branches that carry the
#522 layout, so main and placement could no longer be A/B'd on the same corpus.
