"""Self-recording of board-mutating tool invocations (issue #132).

The stress-test redo harness replays the exact command sequence a board run
executed. Recording used to live only in tests/stress/run_limited.sh, so it
fired only when a command was actually routed through that wrapper -- and the
LLM agent does not always do so. Having each board-mutating CLI record its OWN
invocation makes capture reliable regardless of how the tool was launched.

Each of route.py / route_diff.py / route_planes.py /
repair_planes.py / bga_fanout.py calls record_invocation() at the
top of main(). It is a no-op unless the REDO_MANIFEST env var points at a
manifest file (run_board.sh sets it to <run-dir>/redo_commands.sh; set it to
/dev/null or leave it unset to disable). The manifest format matches what
redo_stress_test.py expects: a '# cwd=<dir>' line followed by the fully-quoted
command on the next line.

    Stress agents re-export REDO_MANIFEST as "$PWD/redo_commands.sh" even though
    run_board.sh already exports the absolute run-dir path. That is correct only
    while PWD is the run dir -- and agents `cd` into the repo to import
    kicad_parser, after which $PWD is the CHECKOUT. The record then lands in
    py_router/redo_commands.sh, so the board's own manifest is silently missing
    those steps (qfhmix01: 3 of 24 steps recorded into the repo, 2026-08-06) and
    the repo accumulates untracked debris.

    REDO_RUNDIR (exported by run_board.sh) is the authority: relative paths
    resolve against it, and a path that lands inside this checkout is redirected
