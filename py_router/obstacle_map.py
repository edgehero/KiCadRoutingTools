    must stay ``local_clearance`` off the hole wall unless it actually lands

      (ghoul's zero-ring switch holes carry 0.3) widens the required disc.
    * PTH pads (``include_plated``): own-net pads are skipped by the
      copper-pad blockers entirely (exclude_net_id), so nothing keeps a
      same-net track off the hole of a zero-annular-ring pad. Stamp the
      override radius, but leave cells whose center lies inside the pad
      copper (bounding-disc approximation, ``max(size)/2``) free so a

    Resolved ENGINE-SIDE off ``PCBData.source_path`` (the #498 mechanism built
    for exactly this), so both fronts inherit it with no wiring. An explicit
    ``config.hole_clearance`` wins and stops the read.

    ``pcb_file`` overrides the parsed ``source_path`` when a caller holds the
    authoritative path -- the #498 rule the rest of the toolchain follows,
    "the CALLER's path when it has one, else ``PCBData.source_path``". Added
    for #761: a board staged into a temp dir and parsed from there carries a
    ``source_path`` that is not the board the caller means, and
    ``grade_pad_legality``/``QuenchState`` already thread ``pcb_file`` to
    ``PadClearanceModel.for_board`` for exactly that reason. Default ``None``
    keeps every existing caller bit-identical.

    TWO sources, and the larger wins: ``design_settings.rules`` (what the
    project declares NOW) and ``kicad_routing_tools.fab_floor_origin`` (what it
    declared before this chain touched it). The second is needed because the
    first is not durable -- each writeback clamps the live rule down to the
    clearance that step routed at, so a chain ERASES the author's declaration
    after step 1. Measured on a tigard pour+route chain declaring 0.25: the
    pour left ``rules`` at 0.15 and the route step read 0.15, i.e. below the
    0.20 fab floor, and stopped honouring the board without saying anything.
    Reading the origin too makes the declaration survive the whole chain, which
    is the only reading under which "the board declares 0.25" means what a user
    would expect. See :func:`fix_kicad_drc_settings.declared_fab_floor`.

    WHO ACTUALLY INHERITS IT, precisely -- everything routed through
    ``add_drill_hole_obstacles`` (signal, diff pairs, BGA/QFN fanout, via
    ``build_base_obstacle_map``), plus ``plane_obstacle_builder`` which builds
    its own map and therefore needed the call adding separately. #617 added the
    call at every site that DECIDES WHERE COPPER GOES in the three engines this
    docstring used to name as uncovered: ``plane_region_connector``
    (``npth_floor_ok`` seeds, ``wide_route_clear`` legs, ``build_base_obstacles``
    stamps), ``pcb_modification`` (``_seg_worst_offender``'s shortfall ranking
    and ``nudge_grazing_microshift``'s detector + acceptance gate) and
    ``placement/fanout_clearance`` (``_Repair``'s NPTH keep-out rects).

    STILL AT THE FLAT ``NPTH_TO_TRACK_CLEARANCE``, and deliberately so -- read
    this before "finishing the job":

    * ``pcb_modification.close_soft_joints`` and ``_connector_clear`` gate a
      BRIDGE between two pieces of copper that already exist (a soft joint's
      caps already overlap; a stub snap spans at most 1.5 track widths). When
      such a bridge violates a declared floor the flanking copper almost always
      does too, so raising the gate drops the repair without removing the
      violation -- measured, 99.96% of the refusals it would add.
    * ``pcb_modification.nudge_grazing_octolinear`` and
      ``placement/fanout_clearance.nudge_vias_for_unresolved`` are all-or-
      nothing repairs: refusing their one clearing candidate abandons the
      defect they exist to fix (measured: a -0.1 mm net-to-net overlap left in
      place; a #130 pad-via graze left unrelocated) rather than routing around
      the hole.

      **This bullet survived #756, which tried to raise a floor there and
      found out why not.** That change wanted
      ``nudge_vias_for_unresolved``'s via-DRILL-to-via-DRILL floor to follow
      the board's ``min_hole_to_hole`` (a different key from this helper's --
      ``list_nets._FLOOR_SOURCES``' ``hole_to_hole`` rather than
      ``hole_clearance``), because ``check_drc`` ``_pin_up``s exactly that
      value and both of its drill arms add it, so the pass was emitting drill
      pairs its own grader then flagged.

      A ONE-RUNG RAISE WAS MEASURED AND REJECTED, by this bullet's own
      argument: a review swept 8673 configurations of that pass's rig shape and
      625 lost the repair at the shipped 0.6 mm budget, 13 of them abandoning a
      landing ``check_drc`` grades CLEAN. What shipped is a two-rung ladder --
      prefer the declared floor, re-sweep at the fab floor when nothing clears
      -- whose second rung is the pre-#756 behaviour exactly. So the site
      stopped being all-or-nothing for that floor rather than the rule being
      bent for it, and the copper-to-hole floors this helper serves are
      untouched and still flat.

      **The lesson to carry, and it cost two reviews to get right:** "the
      grader raises this floor too" is a reason to WANT a raise, never on its
      own a licence to take one here. The question this bullet asks -- what
      happens when the one candidate is refused -- still has to be answered,
      and a ladder is how you answer it without giving up either.
    * ``placement/legality.PartPads`` builds its NPTH keep-out radii from a bare
      ``fp``/``clearance`` pair with no board pointer in hand. **#761 threaded
      the parameter rather than the board**: ``legality.resolve_npth_floor``
      calls this helper ONCE in the caller and passes the resolved float down,
      so ``PartPads`` still holds no board pointer while the two call sites
      that read hole keep-outs (``grade_pad_legality``, ``QuenchState``) do
      carry the declared floor. The four that read only pad rects, extents or
      silk deliberately do not. This bullet is kept, corrected rather than
      deleted, because "it cannot reach here" was true for two issues and a
      reader who remembers it needs to see that it stopped being true.

    The rule the first three encode: raise this floor on passes that CHOOSE
    where new copper goes or that MOVE copper by a measured shortfall, not on
    passes whose only alternative to their one candidate is doing nothing.

    Why it exists: this keep-out was priced at a hardcoded
    ``max(clearance, NPTH_TO_TRACK_CLEARANCE)`` -- a flat 0.20 fab floor -- and
    never read the board, while `check_drc` DOES read `min_hole_clearance`
    (:2390). So on a board declaring 0.25 the router would route into a band its
    own checker then flagged. Measured: a route came within 0.2263 mm of BUS1's
    NPTH against a declared 0.25, a real 0.0237 mm violation, routing-introduced
    and confirmed independently by kicad-cli. It was the single DRC failure on
    that board.

    Cached per board path: the obstacle map is rebuilt per net, and this would
    otherwise re-read the project file thousands of times in one run.
