"""Exact zone-fill geometry from KiCad itself (pcbnew ZONE_FILLER).

Why this exists
---------------
ZoneFillModel and the oracle's island tracer are RASTER APPROXIMATIONS of
KiCad's fill. At marginal sites -- a pour pinched to ~the min-thickness
threshold, a corridor carved by clearance the model prices differently --
the approximation grades the fill CONNECTED where KiCad's exact polygon
math splits it. Every repair actor keyed off the model (region joiner,
island tracer) then sees one region where KiCad sees two, and the only
remaining actor is the link-router, which cannot handle zone|zone links
(zero-length: both endpoints are the pinch point) or walled endpoints.

This module asks KiCad for the truth: drive pcbnew's ZONE_FILLER headless
(refill + save, the fill-fidelity ground-truth recipe), then parse the
saved board's (filled_polygon ...) blocks. Each filled_polygon is one
connected island polygon -- island discovery comes free with the geometry,
so one pcbnew run yields both the diagnosis and the strap targets.

The pcbnew script is STRAIGHT-LINE module scope on purpose: pcbnew
scripting segfaults when board work happens inside functions/loops.

Availability: needs KiCad's bundled python (macOS/Windows) or a system
python with pcbnew (Linux distro installs). All entry points degrade to
None when unavailable; callers fall back to the raster model. That
degradation is SILENT by design, so a discovery bug reads as a modelling
quirk rather than a missing capability -- #647 shipped with the Windows
interpreter unfindable, which cost every Windows user the exact fill in
every consumer. Set `KICAD_PYTHON` to override the search, and print the
reason (not just the symptom) when falling back.
