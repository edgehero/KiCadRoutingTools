    Find disconnected regions within a zone using flood fill on a grid.

    Checks connectivity across copper layers - regions are considered connected if
    they can reach each other through vias, through-hole pads, or segments.

    On layers WITH zones: flood fill through unblocked copper
    On layers WITHOUT zones: only traverse along same-net segments
