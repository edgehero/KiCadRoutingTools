"""Global planning pass (#589): fast rough routes for every net BEFORE
detailed routing, whose predicted paths become soft corridor reservations
and a smarter (plan-informed) net order.

Each net is probe-routed once -- high heuristic weight (near-greedy A*),
small STATIC iteration cap (<= 10k disarms the #529 dynamic extension) --
against a throwaway BASE-style obstacle map that excludes every net being
routed. Rough paths therefore never see each other and never dead-end on
future nets' stubs: the issue's "relaxed legality", with no Rust search
mode. Existing committed copper stays hard. Probes commit nothing (the
bus_corridor precedent); the probe map is throwaway because
route_net_with_obstacles leaves endpoint-exempt / allowed-cell /
unblock-via residue on the map it routes on, which must not leak into the
run's real maps. (Known benign residue shared with bus corridor probes:
a boxed-endpoint probe can register small-rung via cells in
pcb_data._unblock_via_sizes -- a tighten-only statement about board
geometry that stays correct whether or not the probe path ships.)

The plan's three outputs:

1. **Corridor reservations** -- per-net [layer, gx, gy, cost] fields built
   by the ripped-route-ghost stamp (compute_ripped_route_costs, width-aware
   per #585 item 3) at the plan's own cost/radius knobs. They ride
   merge_track_proximity_costs' ghost_costs (the congestion2/history
   pattern) via add_plan_source below, so composition (max/sum/softcap,
   #584) applies unchanged. Owner-exempt by construction: the fold skips
   the net being routed, skips nets already routed (real copper + its
   track-proximity entry supersede the prediction), and skips nets with an
   ACTIVE ripped-route ghost (the actual vacated corridor outranks the
   prediction; in sum mode the two would double-charge).

2. **Plan-informed ordering** -- pairwise corridor conflicts measured on
   the predicted paths (same-layer bucket co-occupancy), not on MPS's
   straight MST chords. 'planar' peels fewest-conflicts-first (MPS
   semantics with honest inputs); 'contended' routes the most-contended
   corridors first (claim scarce lanes early -- the #472 / bus-corridor
   doctrine). The #472 direct-first partition is preserved: blocks are
   reordered independently, never merged.

3. **Congestion-v2 demand seeding** (optional, 'c2') -- rough path points
   join the terminal demand map, replacing endpoints-only demand with
   actual predicted corridors ("rough paths ARE the demand map").

Env-gated experiment (KICAD_GLOBAL_PLAN=1; see env_knobs.GLOBAL_PLAN): no
CLI flag and no GUI control -- both fronts reach it through batch_route, so
GUI/CLI parity holds by construction. Promotion to a real flag requires the
full parity wiring per CLAUDE.md. Evaluation per the #584/#586 discipline:
12-board chain screen ranked by the pad verdict, wall time and via counts
graded, then full-set A/B. Probe iterations are added to the run's
total_iterations -- the pass competes honestly with just spending those
iterations on detailed search.

Deliberately NOT in v1: via-site reservations (the plan collects each rough
route's via positions in via_sites, but folding them into the stub map
prices them at the RIP-avoidance knobs and needs #588's scarcity thinking);
negotiated-congestion re-probing (PathFinder v2 -- measure one cheap pass
first); diff pairs (route_diff has the same seam; port after the
single-ended verdict).
