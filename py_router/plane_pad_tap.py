"""
Single-pad plane tap placement with fine-pitch parameter escalation.

Shared by repair_planes.py (per-pad repair pass, issue #99 -- run in-run by
route.py's #562 plane finalize) and the route-side rungs (#189 via-in-pad
unblock, net_rescue, phase-3 inflight copper). route_planes.py's fine-pitch
tap retry (#104) was deleted with the tap loop (#562); only
clamp_tap_via_to_edge is still imported there.

A "tap" is a stitching via near a pad plus an optional short trace from the
via to the pad on the pad's layer. The default route_planes parameters
(grid 0.1mm, clearance 0.25mm, track 0.3mm) cannot thread between the pads
of 0.4-0.65mm pitch QFN/LQFP parts; the proven fine parameters from the
castor_pollux stress run (grid 0.05mm, clearance 0.15mm, track <= 0.15mm)
recover those pads. The fine retry is scoped to a single pad: obstacle maps
are built on a small window around the pad so a fine grid stays cheap even
on large boards.

# --- Cross-pad via-obstacle-map reuse (issue #263) -----------------------------
# In a plane-repair net-pass every tapped pad excludes the SAME plane net, so
# build_via_obstacle_map yields an identical map for every pad at a given
# parameter set (only other-net copper blocks vias, and the grid is absolute).
# Rebuilding a ~15k-segment window map per pad (~0.29s x hundreds of taps on
# daisho) dominated the repair pass; instead build the map ONCE on the whole
# board per parameter set and reuse it across pads, applying copper changes
# incrementally. Query results are identical: within the via search radius the
# window map and the whole-board map block the same cells (the window pulls in
# every item whose keep-out can reach the search area, and the window-edge band
# sits beyond the search radius) -- asserted per tap under TAP_MAP_VERIFY=1.
