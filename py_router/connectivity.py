    fragments that then win both slots, silently dropping the small island
    the rescue was aimed at (USB_D_P: the window cut the trunk at the USB
    connector, the A* tried to re-join trunk-to-trunk with its target
    parked in the fence ring, and the BGA ball island was never a target).

    Here the caller knows the gap: every copper endpoint, pad, and via of
    the net is assigned to the nearer of the two anchor points (the gap's
    ends, board mm). Trunk fragments land together on the trunk side no
    matter where the crop cut them; the rescued island lands opposite.
    Rows are get_net_endpoints-shaped: (gx, gy, layer_idx, orig_x, orig_y).

    island_points: when the caller knows the actual copper PARTITION (the
    rescue's union-find components), pass the island side's points as a set
    of (round(x,3), round(y,3)) -- assignment is then by MEMBERSHIP, never
    proximity: island copper -> side B, everything else -> side A. Without
    it, proximity mis-assigns whenever the gap is short and trunk copper
    passes nearer anchor B than the island does (dilemma M_COL4_L: a
    2.48mm gap put trunk cells on BOTH sides, the route joined
    trunk-to-trunk 4.5mm from the gap, and the rescue's verify undid it
    every retry -- the net shipped open though the window route existed).

    """Deterministic wrapper: sort the endpoint lists by POSITION.

    The candidate lists are built by walking pcb_data.segments / pads, so their
    ORDER follows the order copper happens to sit in the board. Consumers take
    `sources[0]` / `targets[0]` as the net's representative endpoint -- notably
    layer_swap_optimization, which derives each net's src/tgt LAYER from them --
    so a different segment order silently flipped which end is "source".

    That is a real cross-front divergence, not a theoretical one. The GUI adds
    copper to the live board in its own order while the CLI writer emits it in
    another, so the same board (identical segment SET, 1159 of 1159) yields
    different segment ORDER. Measured on eth_tap step 11:

        /Thru Path/ETH0_MDC   run A: src=In1.Cu tgt=F.Cu
                              run B: src=F.Cu  tgt=In1.Cu   (flipped)

    which made the greedy swap-pair test `src1 == tgt2 and tgt1 == src2` match
    for two extra pairs (7 applied vs 5), changed MPS crossing conflicts
    (346 vs 348) and hence the routing order, and left 27 of 295 nets routed
    differently -- 3486 segments vs the CLI's 3428. Every earlier comparison
    used SETS, which is why the order difference stayed invisible.

    Sorting by the endpoint tuple (grid x, grid y, layer index, x, y) makes the
    representative a function of GEOMETRY rather than of board order, so both
    fronts agree regardless of how the copper got there. This is a behaviour
    change for the CLI too (its own order was equally arbitrary) and wants a
    corpus A/B before being treated as settled.
