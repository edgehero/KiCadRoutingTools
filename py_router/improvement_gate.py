"""Board-level improvement gate (#600): never ship a board a run made WORSE.

Why this exists
---------------
`route.py` may rip already-routed copper -- the in-run finalize/reconciliation
rips a routed net to clear a blocker or place a plane tap, and
`--rip-existing-nets` retry rounds rip nets as blockers -- and a rip whose
restore is refused (its corridor was taken by copper routed while it was
ripped) leaves that net broken. The run then reports the damage honestly and
writes the board anyway. In the sets-21-27 wave that was the single largest
source of lost connectivity, larger than routing failure itself: 7 of 99
boards, `bms_sensor` turning a 3-pad problem into a 20-pad one while trying to
fix it, `spartan6_4layer` losing 20 nets all of their copper.

The missing half was never detection -- the coverage gate and the #293 warning
both fire correctly. It was that **a rip which cannot be restored was not
treated as a reason to roll back**. In every recorded case the pre-rip board
was the better artifact.

Scoping the retry does NOT protect you: `ftdi_debug_toolkit` regressed from a
retry naming three nets. It is the rip PERMISSION that does the damage, not
the route scope -- so this gate is about permission and outcome, and lives at
the write boundary where every rip entry point converges.

The measurement
---------------
Per multi-pad net, "is it fully connected", by the same authoritative
union-find (`check_net_connectivity`) and the same within-outline rule
(`net_break_within_outlines`) route.py's own coverage gate and check_connected
use -- so a verdict here cannot disagree with the engine's own sweep or with
the grader.

- **lost**    -- connected BEFORE, broken AFTER. The regression this exists for.
- **gained**  -- broken (or bare) BEFORE, connected AFTER. The run's actual work.

A run is REJECTED when it ends worse on EITHER axis: more nets broken than it
connected, **or** more disconnected pads than it started with. Both must be
non-worse to ship.

Neither axis may outvote the other, and `spartan6_4layer` is why. Re-running
its wave command produced:

    lost 36 nets, gained 43   ->  net count says BETTER by 7
    disconnected pads 83 -> 154  ->  the board's open pads nearly DOUBLED

An earlier version of this gate compared the two lexicographically with the net
count first, and shipped that board: the 36 lost nets were far larger than the
43 gained ones, so a favourable net count hid a doubling of open pads. Pad count
is the honest measure of how much of the board is unreachable -- it is what the
graders report and what a human sees as damage -- so a run that increases it is
worse no matter how the net tally looks.

This is still not an "any regression" test. A pass that closes five nets and
breaks one ships, provided the pad count did not rise: the recovered pads
outnumber the lost ones, which is exactly the case where discarding the run
would throw away more than it saves.

An exact draw on both axes ships, and is reported loudly with both net lists.
`bms_sensor`'s retry reproduced today closes the three nets it was asked to
close, breaks three others, and leaves the pad count unchanged at 3 -- a
genuine lateral trade. The operator who passed `--rip-existing-nets` authorised
that; what they could not do before is see it.

The prior art is unanimous on why the gate has to exist at all: five separate
measurements (2026-08-05/06) found that the SAME rip authority WITHOUT an
accept gate closes opens and trades them for casualties, while the identical
authority WITH a grade-and-revert gate closes them at zero casualties.
Authority is only safe when someone checks the result and can say no.
