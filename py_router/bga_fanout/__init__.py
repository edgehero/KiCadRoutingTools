"""
BGA Fanout Strategy - Creates escape routing for BGA packages.

The BGA fanout creates:
1. 45-degree stubs from each pad to a routing channel
2. Horizontal or vertical channel segments to exit the BGA boundary
3. Smart layer assignment to avoid collisions on same channel

Key features:
- Generic: works with any BGA package
- Collision-free: tracks on same channel use different layers
- Assumes pads have vias connecting all layers (so any layer can be used)
- Validates no overlapping segments are created
- Differential pair support: P/N pairs routed together on same layer

      0.4mm away read as ANCHORED and ``_strap_unescaped_extras`` never strapped

    * The TRACK arm keeps the pad-box tolerance. "Is there a track endpoint at
      this pad" is a different question, and an endpoint anywhere on the pad
      copper does connect it.

    Module-level rather than a closure because a predicate nothing can call is

    D10's SELF-BLINDNESS, CLOSED HERE (#620). `vias_to_add` was appended to
    below and never read back, and BOTH guards that gate an append iterate
    `pcb_data.vias` only: `would_overlap_existing_via` and
    `via_in_pad_conflict`'s drill loop. So two vias added in ONE call were
    never tested against each other. `PendingVias` (bga_fanout/geometry.py) is
    the missing half, and its docstring argues what it tests -- the drill
    always, the ring only for a via the clamp could not fit inside its pad --
    from a sweep rather than from first principles.

    The impact, which the issue deliberately left UNMEASURED, is measured now:
    on an empty board two 0.30mm-pitch balls with 0.25mm pads ship holes
    0.15mm apart against a 0.20mm fab floor, `added=2 blocked=0`, and two
    coincident same-net balls ship TWO `(via ...)` s-exprs at one point. The
    issue's own worked example -- 0.5mm pitch, via 0.45, clearance 0.1 -- was
    right to hedge: `clamp_via_to_pad` shrinks that via to the ball pad first
    and the pair is legal. **No board in this repo reaches the refusal branch
    at CLI defaults**, which is why the evidence is a constructed fixture and
    the corpus arms are a safety check, not a headline.

    The cost is stated where it is paid: a refusal drops the escape (see the
    #756 block below), so the conflict branch descends the fab drill ladder
    before giving one up, and `--fab-overrides` -- which collapses that ladder
    to one hard rung -- cannot descend at all. That is the configuration the
    #620 contributor measured as pure loss, and their measurement is why this
    has a ladder and a same-site rule at all.

    THREE RESIDUALS, named rather than hidden. An adversarial review found the
    second and third; all are deterministic, none is a correctness bug, and
    each costs escapes in a case no in-repo board reaches.

    1. A conflict is resolved against the vias committed SO FAR, while the two
       whole-net drops that run after this function returns (`esc_dropped`, and
       the via-vs-foreign-track pass) can later delete a via a refusal was
       measured against. Twins are immune -- same net, dropped together -- but
       a distinct-pair loser is not recoverable once its tracks are gone.
    2. The loser of a conflict is whichever route arrives LATER, with no
       tiebreak. Route order is a deterministic list order, so the output is
       reproducible, but it is not escape-maximising: three balls in a row at
       0.30mm pitch keep 2 escapes in four of six route permutations and 1 in
       the two that place the middle ball first.
    3. A refusal costs the net's WHOLE fanout, not the one ball, because the
       caller drops every route of a blocked net (the #508 coherence rule at
       this function's call site). The disclosure below says so.

    `via_in_pad_conflict`'s drill floor was the OTHER gap here -- priced at
    the flat `routing_defaults.HOLE_TO_HOLE_CLEARANCE` rather than the
    board's own `min_hole_to_hole`, the D9/D11 substitute-a-constant class.
    **Closed by #756**, in the shape `qfn_fanout` and `underpad.py` already
    use: board-first through `list_nets.board_floor`, wrapped raise-only at
    the fab floor. Both of its arms take that one number; it deliberately does
    NOT adopt the 0.45 `pad_hole_to_hole` the via-nudge charges for the same
    via-drill-to-pad-drill pair (see the comment at the resolution site).

    **The cost, which the via-nudge half does not pay:** a refusal here
    DROPS the escape rather than searching again, so a tighter floor can
    turn an escaped ball into a failed net. The via-nudge answers that with
    a two-rung ladder; this pass had no second rung to descend to. Stated
    at the resolution site with the numbers. #620 gives the SAME-CALL arm one
    (`thin_drill_to_clear`); the board-facing arm above still has none, so a
    board declaration can still refuse an escape outright.

    One rung, the tightest. Walking the whole ladder costs a full escape
    rebuild per rung -- ~200s each on a 285-ball 0.5mm array, and the
    escape-priority machinery already calls this more than once -- while an
    intermediate rung cannot fit where the floor does not.

    A dropped ball is an unrouted net the downstream router usually cannot
    rescue either -- it has no copper to pick up. The nominal width is a
    preference, not a constraint: the fab floor is what the board can actually
    be built to, so shrink toward it rather than shipping a hole. Each rung
    re-routes ONLY the still-failed balls, against the copper already
    committed (appended to pcb_data so the retry's obstacle build and its
    existing-copper checks both see it), so a narrower escape can thread a
    channel the nominal width could not while never grazing what shipped.

    Track, via AND clearance shrink together, because on a fine-pitch array the
    binding constraint is usually the CLEARANCE, not the track: between adjacent
    0.23mm pads on a 0.5mm pitch the gap is 0.27mm and a track needs
    `track + 2*clearance`, so orangecrab U3 does not fit at 0.1/0.1 (0.30), nor
    even at the 0.0762 track floor (0.276) -- only dropping clearance to the
    0.09 floor (0.256) opens it. Shrinking track/via alone rescued nothing
    there. Each rung is a real fab floor, and the caller's `--clearance` is a
    preference the ladder is explicitly allowed to escalate below (the same
    standard->advanced escalation the via clamp and the plane taps already do);
    the routed floor is what the .kicad_pro writeback records, so the board is
    graded at what actually shipped.

    Generate BGA fanout tracks for a footprint.

    Creates:
    1. 45-degree stubs from pads to channels
    2. Channel segments extending to BGA boundary exit
    3. Differential pairs routed together on same layer
    4. Vias at pads where routing starts on non-top layer

    Args:
        footprint: The BGA footprint
        pcb_data: Full PCB data
        net_filter: Optional list of net patterns to include
        diff_pair_patterns: Glob patterns for differential pair nets (e.g., '*lvds*')
        layers: Available routing layers (all connected via pad vias)
        track_width: Width of fanout tracks
        clearance: Minimum clearance between tracks
        diff_pair_gap: Gap between P and N traces of a differential pair
        exit_margin: How far past BGA boundary to extend
        primary_escape: Primary escape direction preference ('horizontal' or 'vertical')
        via_size: Size of vias to add at pads (default 0.3mm)
        via_drill: Drill size for vias (default 0.2mm)
        check_for_previous: If True, skip pads that already have fanout tracks
        no_inner_top_layer: If True, inner pads cannot use F.Cu (top layer)
        escape_method: 'auto' (default) runs the channel router and, if it drops
            any ball, retries with the under-pad grid escape and keeps whichever
            escapes more (issue #288). KICAD_FANOUT_AUTO_DOGBONE=1 opts the
            retry into a dogbone-first ladder instead -- rejected as the
            default by the #669 sets1-5 corpus A/B (+10 incomplete, +59 DRC).
            'channel' is the 45-stub + channel router (with
            differential-pair support). 'underpad' is the dense-array grid escape
            (issue #122): every signal ball drops a via in its pad and routes
            straight UNDER the pad field on an inner layer, jogging into a
            between-ball channel only to dodge a via. It escapes fully-populated
            arrays the channel router can't (ulx3s 22x22). When diff_pair_patterns
            are given it escapes those pairs COUPLED (issue #182) - via-free on
            the top layer for edge pairs, on an inner layer with via-in-pad for
            deeper ones - so route_diff picks them up. Power/plane nets are
            skipped (they tap their plane).

    a candidate when it has a net, is not `unconnected-*`, is not a single-pad /

    applies -- the same asymmetry `underpad.is_plane` encodes.

    """BGA fanout: the signal escape engines plus the plane-ball drop pass.

    See _generate_bga_fanout_core for the escape-engine parameters. After the
    signal escape completes (whichever engine won), every skipped plane-net
    ball is dropped to a via -- dog-bone gap site preferred, exact-checked
    via-in-pad fallback -- so the plane poured later picks it up directly
    (#424 D2 / #360). `plane_drop='auto'` (default) detects plane nets from
    the fanout's own exclusions and any existing zones; 'off' disables. The
    KICAD_FANOUT_PLANE_DROP env knob overrides both ('0'/'off' or '1'/'auto'),
    so recorded manifests can A/B the pass without editing. The per-net drop
    report is published as bga_fanout.LAST_PLANE_DROP_REPORT.

    `cancel_check` (#621) is the standard zero-arg cooperative predicate
    (`batch_route` / `create_plane` take the same one). It is honoured at every
    escape pass head and at the under-pad engine's four escape loop heads.
    Balls escaped before it fired keep their tracks and vias; balls it never got
    to are published as bga_fanout.LAST_CANCEL_SKIPPED and are NOT in
    failed_nets. Passing None (the default, and what the CLI passes) is fully
    inert. Its only caller is the GUI's Cancel button / the plan executor's
    Stop.
