    #854. The question a via-merge must answer is not "is that via somewhere
    inside my pad's rectangle" -- it is "does that via touch the copper this
    route starts from". Every emission path in ``bga_fanout/tracks.py`` starts
    the route's first segment at ``route.pad_pos``, and that track lives on an
    INNER or bottom layer while the ball pad lives on the top one, so the pad
    reaches its own track only THROUGH the via. A via that does not overlap the
    track start therefore connects nothing, however deep inside the pad's
    bounding box its centre happens to sit.

    Keying on the pad box instead let a LARGE pad swallow a SMALLER overlapping
    same-net pad's committed via: the large pad's route then shipped an
    inner-layer track starting where no via reaches, and still counted as
    escaped -- the very defect ``would_overlap_existing_via``'s #620 half was
    fixed to prevent. Measured on ``kicad_files/kit-dev-coldfire-xilinx_5213``,
    footprint VR201 (TO-263-5, net GND): the 10.8 x 9.4mm tab's box is
    (5.41, 4.71), a 5.25 x 4.55 paste sub-pad's via sits at dx 2.775 / dy 2.425
    -- inside the box on both axes -- and the adopted via is **3.6853mm** from
    the tab route's track start, against a 0.225mm ring.

    ``track_width`` defaults to 0, i.e. the via's own copper only. That is the
    conservative reading and the right one for a caller that does not know the
    width; the fanout passes its real (fab-clamped) width.

    This is the SECOND time this rule has been a containment test standing in
    for a reach test -- see ``PendingVias.verdict``'s note on the scalar radius
    an adversarial review caught in PR #852, and #695 before it ("credits a pad

    """The via-in-pads ONE ``manage_vias`` call has already committed.

    Everything else in that function tests a candidate against the INPUT board:
    ``would_overlap_existing_via`` and ``via_in_pad_conflict`` both iterate
    ``pcb_data.vias``, and ``vias_to_add`` was appended to and never read back.
    So two vias placed in one call were spaced against the board and against
    nothing else. This is the missing half.

    WHAT IS TESTED, AND WHY IT IS NOT SYMMETRIC:

    * **The drill, always.** The balls are SMD and carry no hole, so every hole
      in the neighbourhood is one this pass is creating: a drill pair too close
      is never a condition the board shipped. It is also the arm with a LEVER --
      a thinner drill can cure it (``thin_drill_to_clear``), and a hole pair
      below the fab floor is not a DRC opinion but an unbuildable board.
    * **The ring, only when a via BULGES past its pad** (clamp status
      ``'floor'``: the ball pad is smaller than the deepest fab rung's via, so
      ``clamp_via_to_pad`` gives up and holds the floor, which the pass already
      warns "still bulges past the pad edge").

      The reason is NOT that a fitting via's ring is free. Two things are true
      at once and only the second is a justification:

        - Ring-to-ring spacing for a via clamped into its pad EQUALS the
          footprint's own pad-to-pad spacing, because both features sit at ball
          centres and the via is no wider than the pad. So the fanout is asking
          the fab for an etch pitch the footprint already demands. A bulging via
          asks for a TIGHTER one, which the board's own geometry does not
          demonstrate is achievable. That is the line the split is drawn on.
        - It is NOT true that a fitting via adds no copper. A ball pad is
          ``['F.Cu']``; the via spans F.Cu to B.Cu. On the inner layers and
          B.Cu there is no pad under the ring at all, so at the same spacing
          the copper IS new, and ``check_drc``'s VIA-VIA arm can legitimately
          flag it. An earlier draft of this docstring called such a pair
          "phantom" on the strength of the F.Cu picture, and an adversarial
          review was right to refuse that.

      There is also no lever on this arm: a via-in-pad site is the ball centre
      by definition, and a bulging via is already at the deepest fab rung, so
      neither moving nor shrinking is available. Refusing removes an escape and
      nothing else. That is why the arm is narrow and why it is disclosed.

      AN EARLIER DRAFT CITED A SWEEP HERE -- "of the ring-only rejections whose
      pads are not already sub-clearance, 100% are bulging vias, at every
      clearance" -- and presented it as the measurement the scope rested on.
      **It is a tautology**, and is recorded here so nobody re-derives it and
      believes it: a ring-only rejection needs ``pitch < via + clearance``, and
      "pads not already sub-clearance" is ``pitch >= pad + clearance``; together
      those give ``pad < via``, which IS the bulge condition. It holds for any
      clamp function whatsoever. ``tests/test_620_pending_via_pairs.py`` now
      pins it AS an identity, and measures the thing that is actually
      contingent: what a bulge-blind ring arm would additionally reject.

    The ring arm is foreign-net only: same-net copper in contact is not a
    clearance violation. (``would_overlap_existing_via``'s board-facing test is
    net-BLIND; that is pre-existing and deliberately not changed here.)

    Scalar ``math.hypot`` with a sorted-by-x broad phase, deliberately NOT
    numpy: numpy's hypot is not CPython's Neumaier-compensated one and the two
    disagree by 1 ULP on ~17% of off-grid inputs, each disagreement feeding a
    ``dist < floor`` comparison -- the finding that closed #786/#787. The broad
    phase is also simply faster at this size (2.0 ms vs 12.8 ms vectorised on
    the largest in-repo BGA, 529 balls).

        The surviving via must be the TIGHTER pad's clamp, so the caller
        tightens on a twin hit. Returns True if anything changed.

        `_max_drill`/`_max_size` are deliberately NOT lowered here: they only
        size the broad-phase window, and leaving them high makes the window
        wider than needed, which cannot miss a conflict. Recomputing them would
        be the only way to make them wrong.

        ``track_width`` is the width of the track this candidate's route will
        emit; a committed via is a twin when it REACHES that route's track
        start at ``via_radius + track_width / 2`` -- see ``via_anchors_route``.
        Default 0 = the via's own copper only.

        THE PAD IS NOT THE TEST, and this took three attempts to get right, so
        it is spelled out.

        * A SCALAR RADIUS was the first bug: ``max(size_x, size_y) / 2 + 0.01``
          against a straight-line distance reaches far outside the copper along
          an OBLONG pad's short axis, and two same-net 0.30 x 1.50 fingers
          0.50mm apart -- an ordinary fine-pitch QFP pair whose pads are 0.20mm
          apart and NOT touching -- were merged into one via, the second route
          shipping with no via at all while still counting as escaped. An
          adversarial review of PR #852 found it, with 17 footprints on 11
          in-repo boards matching the geometry.
        * A PER-AXIS RECTANGLE (``anchor_box``) fixed that and was still the
          wrong question (#854): it closes the equal-size case, because two
          same-net pads of the same size can only be twins if they overlap by
          more than half, but a LARGE pad's box still reaches a small pad whose
          overlap is slight -- and swallows its via. Measured on VR201 of
          ``kit-dev-coldfire-xilinx_5213``: a via **3.6853mm** from the route it
          was supposed to anchor, against a 0.225mm ring.
        * REACH is the question. A pad connects to its own inner-layer track
          only through the via, so a via that does not touch the track start
          connects nothing, wherever its centre sits.

        Returns ``(verdict, detail)``:

        ``('clear', None)``
            nothing committed so far is in the way.
        ``('twin', (x, y, size, drill))``
            the SAME net already has a via INSIDE this ball's pad, so that via
            already connects this ball and a second hole would buy nothing. Two
            routes, one physical hole. An exposed pad modelled as an F.Cu +
            B.Cu pair puts two routes at one coordinate (5 of this repo's 22
            boards do it; ``interf_u`` BUS1 has 31 such sites on one
            component), and distance 0 is below every threshold, so a plain
            spacing test makes twins refuse each other and takes their net with
            them -- while one via serving both routes is strictly better than
            today's, which appends a second identical dict that the writer
            emits as a second ``(via ...)`` at the same point.

            KEYED ON REACH, NOT ON AN EXACT MATCH. An exact-match rule has a
            1 um cliff: an adversarial review found same-net sites 0.0010mm
            apart merging into one via while 0.0011mm apart DROPPED an escape
            outright, because no fab rung can space two holes 1.1 um apart. A
            via that ANCHORS this ball is a via it needs no second hole for,
            which is the question actually being asked -- and every distance-0
            case (an exposed pad modelled as an F.Cu + B.Cu pair) is inside any
            reach, so the cliff stays closed.
        ``('conflict', (reason, x, y))``
            that via is closer than a floor allows. A DIFFERENT net at the same
            site lands here, not in ``'twin'``: two nets sharing one hole is a
            short, and no rung can ever clear distance 0.
