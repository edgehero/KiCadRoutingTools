    A via dropped at a pad centre whose diameter exceeds the pad's smallest
    dimension bulges past the pad copper. A neighbouring different-net trace that
    legitimately cleared the (smaller) pad then grazes the (larger) via -- a real
    VIA-SEGMENT DRC error baked into the board before any signal routing runs
    (the dominant via-seg source on keks: 163 grazes from Ø0.5 vias in 0.41 mm
    pads).

    Clamp the via to the pad's min dimension (a circular via inscribes a
    rect/oval pad at min(size_x, size_y); for a circle pad that is the diameter),
    but NEVER below the fab via floor -- a pad smaller than the smallest
    manufacturable via keeps that floor via (it still bulges) rather than ship an
    unmanufacturable one. The drill follows to hold the annular ring at the fab
    floor.

    The clamp belongs at via PLACEMENT (not a post-pass) so the escape's own
    keep-out modelling uses the real, smaller via and neighbouring fanout tracks
    can route past it.

    ``floors`` is the fab-tier floor LADDER (nominal first, then escalation rungs;
