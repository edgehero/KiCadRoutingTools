"""JLCPCB fab-capability floors, modelled as selectable cost tiers (issue #237),
and the ESCALATION POLICY that says how far below a requested size a routing
step may go (#857 / #842, docs/design-rules-proposal.md).

A *fab tier* is the manufacturing floor the router may shrink tracks/vias/
clearances DOWN toward when a route needs it and the policy allows it:

  - ``standard``  (default, no extra fab cost): a HARD floor. Nothing on the
                  board goes below it.
  - ``advanced``  (JLC "more costly" tier): the tight floor (0.25/0.15 via,
                  0.09 mm track/clearance, ...). A hard floor too.
  - ``auto``      the old default: the standard floor first, escalating to
                  ``advanced`` (with a warning, counted in the run summary)
                  when a fine-pitch fan-out or a last-resort via genuinely
                  cannot fit at the standard floor. Opt-in since #857: the
                  default used to escalate silently, 149 times on one board.

An optional ``--fab-overrides FILE`` (a plain ``key = value`` text file) overlays
the selected tier, replacing **only** the floor values listed in the file (the rest
come from the base tier). Supplying overrides pins the floor to a single **hard**
rung -- escalation is disabled, because the file states the user's exact fab limits.

The **escalation policy** (``--escalation``, one shared control in the GUI) is
orthogonal to the tier and bounds every descent site in the engine:

  - ``off``    sizes and clearances are exact. A net that cannot complete at
               them fails and is reported; nothing is narrowed or shrunk.
  - ``board``  (default) a failing net may be retried narrower / with a smaller
               via / tighter clearance, down to the BOARD'S OWN declared floors
               (Board Setup ``rules.min_*``), i.e. what KiCad's DRC accepts. A
               key the board leaves unset falls back to the fab tier floor for
               that key. The output is DRC-clean against the input project by
               construction.
  - ``fab``    additionally may go below the board's floors down to the fab
               tier floor (the pre-#857 reach), disclosed.

Every descent is recorded in a per-run LEDGER (``note_narrowing`` /
``escalation_summary``) that the routing mains put in JSON_SUMMARY and print
once at the end of the run; ``--strict-sizes`` turns a non-empty ledger into a
non-zero exit.

Values are sourced from jlcpcb.com/capabilities (saved at ~/Downloads/pcb_specs.mhtml,
2026-06): standard via 0.20 drill / 0.45 dia, advanced 0.15 / 0.25 ("more costly");
min drill 0.20 vs 0.15; track/clearance 0.10/0.10 (1-2 layer) vs 0.09/0.09 multilayer
(3 mil OK in BGA fan-outs); PTH annular recommended 0.25 (2L) / 0.20 (ML) vs absolute
minimum 0.18 / 0.15; Via hole-to-hole 0.20, Pad hole-to-hole 0.45.

This module is intentionally **stdlib-only** so the lightweight DRC-settings script can
import it without pulling in the PCB parser. ``list_nets`` re-exports the public names,
so ``from list_nets import fab_floors`` keeps working.

    not a fab fact: JLC publishes one multilayer capability column (see the
    module docstring's source line) and this module does not invent the rest.

    A consumer that COMPARES two layer counts cannot otherwise tell "the floor
    genuinely does not move" from "this table cannot see the difference", and
    `placement.options.add_layers` -- the only such consumer -- printed the
    first while meaning the second on every board above 2 copper layers. On a

    lanes on a face" (issue #700).

    A SEPARATE FUNCTION, not a key on the floor dict: the floor dicts contain
    exactly ``FLOOR_KEYS`` and are written out as-is --
    ``list_nets.effective_floors`` returns one under ``'fab'`` and
    ``read_design_rules`` embeds that whole structure as a documented public
    return -- so a key added there silently joins that contract. Several
    consumers also index the dict directly.

    TAKES ONE ARGUMENT ON PURPOSE. No ``tier``, no ``overrides``: an override
    file must not be able to forge provenance, and giving it no channel is the
    only way to guarantee that rather than promise it. (``fab_floor_ladder``
    can today only REPLACE keys already present, but "cannot today" and
    "cannot by construction" are different guarantees.)

    Returns a ``FabBucket`` -- a NamedTuple rather than a dict so a mistyped
    field raises instead of returning ``None``, which is the silent-default
    failure this whole function exists to end (see ``options.deficit_totals``
    for the one that cost "38 faces are short" -> "0").

    min_hole_to_hole 0.3) the copper rule asks 0.39mm and the drill rule 0.5mm,
    so a pair placed to the copper rule sits 0.088mm inside the fab's drill
    spacing. The router READ the board constraint correctly and then never
    applied it to via placement.

    Lifted here from ``diff_pair_routing._min_via_center_distance`` so a
    stdlib-only, parser-free consumer can reach it. The placement escape ledger
    needs exactly this arithmetic, and importing ``diff_pair_routing`` from
    ``placement/escape.py`` costs a measured **+126 modules** -- including the
    Rust ``grid_router``, numpy, ``kicad_parser`` and ``obstacle_map`` -- into
    a module whose own docstring says "numpy only; no networkx in the placement
    stack" and which ``board_brief`` and ``routability.health`` import on every

    machine-independent half, so that is the number quoted.) From here it is
    +1 module / ~4ms from a bare ``placement.escape`` import, and +0 once
    ``list_nets`` is loaded -- which the ledger's own ``lane_pitch`` does.

    VALUES IN, not a config object: ``py_placer`` has no ``GridRouteConfig`` to
    hand it, and a values-in signature is what lets both fronts share one rule
    rather than one of them re-deriving it.

    ``hole_to_hole`` of ``None`` means NO DRILL RULE DECLARED and yields the
    copper rule alone -- inherited verbatim from the adapter's long-standing
    ``getattr(config, 'hole_to_hole_clearance', 0.0) or 0.0``. Worth naming
    because it is the permissive direction on the constraint this function
    exists to enforce: every caller in the tree resolves the value through
    ``list_nets.resolve_cli_floor`` or the GUI's floored spin control, and
    ``GridRouteConfig.hole_to_hole_clearance`` defaults to 0.20, so no reachable
