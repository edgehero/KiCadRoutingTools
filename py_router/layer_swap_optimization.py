"""
Layer swap optimization for PCB routing.

This module handles the upfront layer swap optimization that happens before routing:
- Diff pair source and target layer swaps
- Single-ended source and target layer swaps
- Solo switches and retry loops

The goal is to minimize the number of vias needed by swapping stubs to compatible layers.
