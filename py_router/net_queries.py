    `fnmatch(net_name, pattern)` therefore makes the unqualified spelling people
    actually write -- `--nets '*' '!GND'` -- match NOTHING, so the exclusion
    silently no-ops and the net gets routed anyway. That is issue #292

    whose step-1 fanout shipped 267 '/GND' + 171 '/3V3' segments out of 750 from
    a command that asked to exclude both.

    """Nets touching the footprints matched by `patterns` (issue #537).

    This is the single implementation of "the nets of these components". It
    replaced four divergent ones that disagreed about the only question that
    matters -- whether 'U1' also means U10, U12 and U100 -- so the same request
    selected different nets on the CLI, in the GUI, and in a replayed plan.
    Callers pick the policy explicitly via `match` (see
    :func:`component_ref_matches`) instead of inheriting whichever loop they
    happened to be written next to.

    mode:
      ``any``       net has >=1 pad on a matched footprint (the historical
                    behaviour of every call site, and the default)
      ``between``   net reaches >=2 DISTINCT matched footprints -- the wires
                    running between the selected parts. Note this is stricter
                    than ">=2 matched pads": two pads of one net on a single
                    matched footprint run between nothing.
      ``internal``  EVERY pad of the net is on a matched footprint -- the nets
                    that do not leave the selected block. Beware that this is
                    near-empty for a SINGLE selected footprint, which reads as a
                    bug rather than as the correct answer it is.

    `exclude_patterns` (e.g. POWER_NET_EXCLUSION_PATTERNS) drops matching nets
    from the result and reports them in `excluded_names`, so a caller can say
    what it dropped rather than dropping it silently.

    fine-pitch chip packages (BGA/QFN/QFP) whose net has NOT yet escaped the
    pad -- the future escape needs the surrounding space, so routing is
    discouraged near it.

    #585 item 8 added two gates. Both are ON by default (f785a7e's shipped
    behaviour) and independently disablable with =0. They were briefly defaulted
    OFF on a two-board 2x2 whose spread turned out comparable to its own noise;
    two corpus A/Bs then measured ON BETTER -- by 3 nets on 148 boards, and by 2
    on 129 boards with smoothing restored (7 boards better, 4 worse). They stay
    SEPARATE knobs because the two are wildly asymmetric in reach: on spartan6's
    final board the retire gate removes 95% of emitters (667 -> 33 pads) while
    the package gate removes a third (667 -> 448).

    - `KICAD_FINE_PITCH_PSEUDO_STUBS` (default ON) -- emit only for BGA/QFN/QFP. Introduced
      to stop 4-pad capacitors and dense connectors emitting fields, reasoning
      that "coarse pads need no escape protection". But the field protects
      ARRIVAL as much as escape, and without it nets could not REACH multi-pin
      headers: spartan6_6layer went 2 -> 7 incomplete nets across this commit,
      three of four casualties on 24-pin headers H1/H5/H7 (package 'OTHER'),
      and the same class took cubesat_backplane's /H2-* nets.

      Its stacking rationale is also weaker than it looks under the shipped
      default: composition is MAX (KICAD_PROXIMITY_SUM unset), so N overlapping
      fields cost the max, not the sum -- a connector cannot inflate cost by
      concentration unless an opt-in sum/zoned/softcap mode is selected.

    - `KICAD_PSEUDO_STUB_RETIRE` (default ON) -- drop the proxy once same-net copper reaches
      the pad, on the grounds that the real stub endpoint takes over as the
      proximity signal. Plausible, but it retires on ANY attachment: a header
      pad with one stub on it stops defending the corridor the REST of its
      route still needs.

    Kept as knobs rather than reverted because the trade is real and
    board-dependent: a "re-admit dense connectors" variant regressed glasgow
    while helping lpddr4 (#585 item 8). The likely missing piece is MAGNITUDE,
    not membership -- the radius is a flat STUB_PROXIMITY_RADIUS (2.0mm)
    whether the pad is a 0.5mm BGA ball or a 2.54mm header pin, so re-admitted
    headers got a BGA-sized keep-out. A pitch-scaled radius would settle it.

    The MPS approach identifies crossing conflicts between nets and orders them
    so that non-conflicting nets are routed first. This reduces routing failures
    caused by earlier routes blocking later ones.

    Algorithm:
    1. For each net, find its two stub endpoint centroids
    2. Project all endpoints onto a circular boundary centered on the routing region
    3. Assign each endpoint an angular position on the boundary
    4. Detect crossing conflicts: nets A and B cross if their endpoints alternate
       on the boundary (A1, B1, A2, B2 or B1, A1, B2, A2 ordering)
    5. Build a conflict graph where edges connect crossing nets
    6. Use greedy algorithm: repeatedly select net with fewest active conflicts,
       add to result, and remove its neighbors from consideration for this round
    7. Continue until all nets are ordered (multiple rounds/layers)

    Args:
        pcb_data: PCB data with segments
        net_ids: List of net IDs to order
        center: Optional center point for angular projection (auto-computed if None)
        diff_pairs: Optional dict of pair_name -> DiffPair. If provided, P and N nets
                    of each pair are treated as a single routing unit.
        use_boundary_ordering: If True, use chip boundary unrolling for crossing detection.
                              This respects the physical constraint that routes can't go
                              through BGA chips. Default is False (use angular projection).
        return_extended_info: If True, return MPSResult with conflict and layer info
                             instead of just ordered IDs. Used for MPS-aware layer swaps.
        use_segment_intersection: If True, use MST segment intersection for crossing detection.
                                 If None (default), auto-detect: use segment intersection when
                                 no net endpoints are on chips.

    Returns:
        If return_extended_info=False: Ordered list of net IDs, with least-conflicting nets first
        If return_extended_info=True: MPSResult with full conflict/layer/round info
