"""
Multi-point differential pair routing.

A diff pair cannot tap onto the middle of an existing pair of tracks - the
P/N tracks of the tapping leg would have to cross the existing pair. So
multi-point pairs (3+ pad-pair terminals, e.g. connector -> termination
resistor -> IC pins) are routed as a CHAIN of terminals:

- Each terminal (a P pad + N pad on the same component) has an escape axis
  perpendicular to its pad axis, with two usable sides.
- A terminal can host at most two legs, one out each side. A continuation
  leg leaves on the OPPOSITE side from the leg that arrived, so the chain
  passes "through" the pads without crossing.
- Polarity is resolved per leg geometrically (by choosing the side at the
  fresh terminal). Pad swaps are never used: a swap at a shared terminal
  would break the already-routed leg.
