# forcing the lattice (tests/test_505_diagonal_margin.py) bears this out --

# 4 ...; 2*sqrt(2) and sqrt(13) never appear. Including them would let the

    Two failures the raw orthogonal margin has:

    1. It is derived from AXIS-ALIGNED rows (1 cell apart), but the router also
       moves at 45 degrees, where rows sit 1/sqrt(2) cells apart and the step
       from the stamp shell to the next row is sqrt(2). Worst case over all
       obstacle orientations and sub-cell phases, the margin has to reach
       e*sqrt(2) (brute-forced over the lattice in tests/test_505_*).
    2. Any value strictly between two lattice distances behaves like the lower
       one, so a margin of 1.25 rejects exactly what 1.0 rejects.

    Snapping to the lattice is what makes the margin bite while staying below
    the blunt e+1 wherever a lattice distance falls in between (e=1.25 -> 2.0,
    not 2.25). Measured: polykit_x let a 45-degree power track sit at 0.565685mm

        The result is then snapped onto the lattice (_snap_to_lattice_reach),

        convention as every other soft knob. (Historically 0 meant BLOCK
        vias in proximity zones; that inverted mode -- 0 as the STRONGEST
        setting -- is removed. The single-ended router multiplies the
        graded proximity cost by this value, so 0 is naturally inert
        there.) Any positive fraction rounds to at least 1 (soft-knobs
        review B3: a GUI value of 0.5 passed through bare int() became 0,
        silently weaker than both settings around it).
