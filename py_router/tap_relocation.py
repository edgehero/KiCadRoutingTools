"""Single-tap relocation (#424, planes-first chains).

When a route fails and the decisive blocker is PRE-EXISTING plane-net
copper, the rip ladder is helpless: pre-existing nets are not rippable, and
whole-net --rip-existing-nets is catastrophically mis-grained for "this one
tap via is in my way" (ripping GND rips - and then reroutes as tracks - the
entire net; see the reconciliation-exclusion fix).

This module implements the right-grained move: remove ONE pre-existing
plane-net via (a tap or dogbone placed by an earlier planes-first / fanout
step) plus its short attached stub, retry the failing net, and rely on the
plane-repair step later in the chain to re-tap the affected pad from the
pour (the net-coverage invariant: copper removed by one stage is re-claimed
by a later stage that owns that net's connectivity -
repair_planes detects and repairs disconnected plane components
by design).

Obstacle-map custody (the part that must be exact): per-net cached cell
data may be deduplicated and the working map is ref-counted (#309), so
removing a hand-computed "this via's cells" set can underflow cells shared
with the net's other copper. Relocation therefore NEVER does per-item map
surgery. It uses whole-net cache recompute with existing primitives:

    remove_net_obstacles_from_cache(map, cache[net])   # net's old data out
    drop the via + stub from pcb_data
    cache[net] = precompute_net_obstacles(...)          # rebuilt from what remains
    add_net_obstacles_from_cache(map, cache[net])       # net's new data in

which is exact regardless of overlap or dedup. Prerequisite: the plane net
must have a cache entry (be base-map-excluded) - the KICAD_TAP_RELOCATION
registration in batch_route arranges this for every net with a filled zone,
WITHOUT adding them to routed_results (the whole-net rip ladder can never
touch them).

Eligibility is deliberately narrow: only nets with a filled zone (repairable
from the pour), only vias within a small radius of the failing endpoint (or
validator-blamed), at most KICAD_TAP_RELOCATION_MAX (default 2) per failing
net. Env-gated overall by KICAD_TAP_RELOCATION=1.
