    Differential (edge-coupled) stripline between UNEQUALLY spaced planes.

    The differential twin of stripline_z0_asymmetric: the effective height is
    the harmonic mean 2*h1*h2/(h1+h2), which is always SMALLER than the
    arithmetic average and therefore yields a lower Zdiff (a trace between two
    planes needs to be narrower than the equivalent microstrip, not wider).

    #607: calculate_impedance_for_layer tested is_asymmetric_stripline() for
    the single-ended answer and then called the symmetric differential model at
    the AVERAGED height three lines later, discarding the asymmetry. On a
    6-layer stack with 0.1mm prepreg and a 0.55mm core, --impedance 90 returned
    a width that the tool scored at 89.83 ohm and a field solver measured at
    67 -- outside USB's 81-99 window, and wide-of-target in the direction
    OPPOSITE to the physics.

    The harmonic-mean substitution is the same approximation the single-ended
    path has used since #486. It is a large improvement, not an exact answer:
    on the stackup above it moves the prediction from +34% to about -10%
    against a method-of-moments solve. The residual is the coupling factor
    itself, which is calibrated for symmetric stripline; closing it needs a
    two-plane closed form or fab-calibrated tables. Deriving the coupling from
    the true plate separation (h1+h2+t) instead was measured WORSE (-18%), so

# the bisection solver compensated by returning a trace ~12% too NARROW on a

# the two compounded to ~20% too narrow (0.144mm where 0.181mm is the
# reference 50-ohm width), i.e. ~57 ohms on a nominally 50-ohm trace.
#
# With the thickness correction fixed, solved widths land within ~1% of the
# Hammerstad-Jensen reference across h = 0.1..1.6mm, so no empirical fudge is
# warranted and this is 1.0. It is kept as a named constant (rather than
# deleted) because it is the documented knob for anyone who needs to bias

    Get effective dielectric constant for propagation delay calculation.

    For microstrip (outer layers): epsilon_eff = (Er + 1) / 2

    Args:
        pcb: Parsed PCB data with stackup
        layer_name: Copper layer name (e.g., "F.Cu", "In1.Cu")
        width: Optional trace width in mm. When given, outer layers use the
            width-dependent Hammerstad er_eff instead of the flat (Er + 1) / 2
            (#486: the flat form is a lower bound -- a real trace always has
            more field in the dielectric than it implies, so delays came out
            short). Inner layers are unaffected: stripline really is er.
        side_gap: Optional measured side gap to coplanar ground in mm. When
            given together with `width` on an outer layer, and the gap is
            close enough to matter (see cpwg_applies), the CPWG er_eff is
            used. It lands BETWEEN the two other forms: above the flat
            (Er + 1) / 2, but below the equivalent microstrip's, because the
            coplanar gaps are air-filled and hold part of the field. So a
            coplanar trace is slightly FASTER than a microstrip of the same
            width, and tightening the gap speeds it up further.
