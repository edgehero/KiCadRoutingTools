    #510 PARTIAL (leg-level) RIP: pass `only_segments` to remove just those
    segments -- the branch that actually blocks the route -- instead of the whole
    net. `only_segments=None` (the default) is the historic whole-net behaviour,
    bit-for-bit, so this is a strict superset and the default path is unchanged.

    A partial rip deliberately does NOT drop the net's surviving copper: it stays
    on the board and in the write-list, and the net is re-queued so the
    multipoint router reconnects the orphaned component (route_multipoint_main
    derives pad_components from existing copper, so it routes only the missing
    edge). The saved record covers exactly the removed segments, so a restore
    puts back that branch and nothing else.

    Args:
        net_id: The net ID to rip up
        pcb_data: The PCB data structure
        routed_net_ids: List of currently routed net IDs
        routed_net_paths: Dict mapping net IDs to their routed paths
        routed_results: Dict mapping net IDs to their routing results
        diff_pair_by_net_id: Dict mapping net IDs to (pair_name, DiffPair) tuples
        remaining_net_ids: List of net IDs that haven't been routed yet
        results: List of routing results
        config: Routing configuration
        track_proximity_cache: Optional cache for track proximity costs
        working_obstacles: Optional working obstacle map for incremental updates
        net_obstacles_cache: Optional cache of net obstacles for incremental updates
        ripped_route_layer_costs: Optional dict to store ripped route layer-specific costs
        ripped_route_via_positions: Optional dict to store ripped route via positions
        layer_map: Optional layer name to index mapping (required for ripped route costs)
        history_conflict: #590 -- True (default) if this rip is CONTENTION
            (another net wanted the ground). Pass False for an own-tree
            re-ask (#444 seam dissolution), which rips a net's own copper to
            re-ask it: no second net is competing, so charging the negotiated-
            congestion field there would price a cell nobody contested.

    Returns:
        tuple: (saved_result, ripped_net_ids, was_in_results) for later restoration
               saved_result: the result dict that was removed
