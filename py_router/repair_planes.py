Repair Planes - Connects disconnected regions within power plane zones.

(Renamed from route_disconnected_planes.py, 2026-08-04.) After power planes
are created, regions may be effectively split due to vias and traces from
other nets cutting through the plane. The repair engine detects disconnected
regions and routes wide, short tracks between them to ensure electrical
continuity.

NOT A CHAIN STEP since #562: route.py's in-run plane finalize calls the
`repair_planes` engine function below on every route step, so the default
chain never invokes this file. The CLI remains as a STANDALONE utility for
boards routed outside the chain (e.g. a hand-routed board whose pours need
welding). Recorded manifests that reference route_disconnected_planes.py
are historical records, not runnable chains.

Usage:
    # Auto-detect all zones in PCB:
    python py_router/repair_planes.py input.kicad_pcb output.kicad_pcb

    # Specific nets and layers:
    python py_router/repair_planes.py input.kicad_pcb output.kicad_pcb \\

    to re-implement zone parsing as a regex over the FILE, which had two
    independent problems (#493 follow-up):

    1. It was DEAD on every modern board. The pattern required
       ``(zone\n (net <int>)`` and then looked up ``(net_name "...")``, but
       KiCad 10 collapsed both into a single quoted ``(net "/GND")``. Every one
       of the 406 corpus boards is the new format, so it returned {} for all 185
       of them that carry zones (2651 zone stanzas, none matched). The caller
       then fell back to the single ``zone_clearance`` for every zone, so the
       fill model -- which decides what the pour already connects, and therefore
       every repair decision -- ran on the wrong inset wherever a zone's real
       clearance differed (measured on real boards: 0.2, 0.25, 0.508mm).
       Self-generated chains mostly got away with it because route_planes.py
       writes zones at the same clearance the repair falls back to; boards with
       PRE-EXISTING pours (the GUI's normal case) did not.
    2. It read ``input_file``. The GUI passes the live board's path, whose
       on-disk content is whatever was last saved -- for a plan run, the
       untouched input board.

    Both go away by reading the already-parsed board. A zone whose clearance is
    0/None is "not specified" in KiCad (use the net class), so it is omitted and
    the caller's fallback applies. Where several zones share a (net, layer), the
    LARGEST clearance wins -- the conservative fill estimate.
