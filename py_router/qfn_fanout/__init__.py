"""
QFN/QFP Fanout Strategy - Creates escape routing for QFN/QFP packages.

Generic module that analyzes actual pad geometry to determine:
- Which side each pad is on (based on position and pad orientation)
- Escape direction (perpendicular to pad's long axis)
- Stub length (based on chip size)
- Fan-out pattern (endpoints maximally separated)

Works with any QFN/QFP package regardless of pin count or size.

    """Signed offsets along the escape axis, under KICAD_QFN_ONPAD_REACH (#846).

    `mode` orders them: 'in' sweeps inward (toward the chip) first, 'near'
    alternates nearest first.

    NOT an "on-pad ladder", though it was called `_onpad` and documented as one.
    Only k = 0 is guaranteed on the pad. The increment is the INTER-NET stagger
    -- the centre-to-centre a via needs from a DIFFERENT net's via at this pitch
    -- and on a fine-pitch part that exceeds the pad: on routed_output's QFN-76
    (pitch 0.40, via 0.45, clearance 0.1) step is 0.4275 against a pad whose
    escape-axis extent is 0.875, so rung 1 lands 0.0100 mm inside the pad EDGE,
    rung 2 is 0.8550 mm out and rung 8 reaches +-3.4199 mm.

    Those rungs ARE load-bearing, measured by
    `tests/sweep_846_onpad_ladder.py` -- committed, so this stays checkable
    rather than remembered: confining the ladder regressed escapes on 1 of 5
    boards ('pad': routed_output U2, 15 -> 10) and 3 of 5 ('barrel'), improved
    none, and left drc_grazes identical arm-to-arm. So the default is 'full' --
    the ladder is right and the NAME was wrong.

    It is also where the long stubs come from, which is what #846 reports: on
    routed_output U2 the longest EMITTED stub is 3.0125 mm against a 0.875 mm
    pad. (An earlier draft of this docstring said 2.9924 mm -- that is the
    ladder's requested OFFSET at k = 7, before `snap()` puts the via on the
    routing grid, not the copper that shipped.)

    KICAD_QFN_ONPAD_REACH picks the arm -- 'full' (default), 'pad' (the via
    CENTRE stays on the pad), 'barrel' (the whole barrel does). An unrecognised
    value is 'full', so a typo cannot silently shorten the ladder.

    Module-level, and the engine's only source for these offsets, because a
    test that restates the arithmetic cannot detect the arithmetic changing:
    the first draft of tests/test_846_onpad_ladder_reach.py rebuilt the ladder
    from the same formula and every knob row of tests/mutate_846.py SURVIVED.

    Whether a via that lands here is IN a pad is not decided here -- the commit
    loop asks `via_overlaps_pad`, the fab question.

    """Does a candidate via (and its stub) collide with THIS RUN's own output?

    D10. The underpad escape's `via_clears` tested a candidate against the
    board it was handed -- `foreign_vias` / `foreign_pads` / `foreign_tracks`
    are a snapshot taken once, before anything is placed -- and against the via
    CENTRES emitted so far. It never saw the STUBS the same run emitted, so it
    approved vias sitting on copper it had just laid itself, and those escapes
    came back DRC CONTACTS.

    Measured: U2 (QFN56) reported 39 of 46 escapes under
    `--escape-method underpad --allow-via-in-pad` and the gate rejected every
    one as a contact -- while the geometry was fine (a 1.4 mm moat admitting a
    0.7 mm via at all 56 pads, `pad_via == 0`, a real 0.700 mm via placeable
    DRC-clean in U2.43, true capacity 11 of 14 lanes per side). A valid escape
    strategy reported as impossible, and two cycles skipped fanout on it.

    `placed` entries are ``(via_x, via_y, net_id, pad_x, pad_y)``; the stub
    runs pad -> via. A through-via conflicts with copper on ANY layer, so the
    stubs are tested exactly the way `foreign_tracks` is -- the difference is
    only that these cannot be in that list.

    Module-level and pure so it is testable directly: the caller is a closure
    over fifteen locals, and a check this consequential should not be reachable
    only by routing a whole board.

    ``adds_via=False`` is the REUSE case (#479 audit gap 2): the position is an
    existing board via, so this run adds no drill and no via copper -- only the
    bridging stub. Everything about that via's spacing is a fact of the input
    board, not something this run creates, so pricing it as a NEW via at
    ``config.via_size`` judges two vias that already exist, at a size neither
    has, for a spacing this run does not produce. Measured on
    kicad_files/routed_output.kicad_pcb U2 (B.Cu, track/clearance 0.1, via
    0.45/0.25, --escape-method underpad --allow-via-in-pad): with the via terms
    applied, all 7 reuse candidates were rejected on the different-net floor
    ``via_size + clearance`` = 0.55 against pre-existing 0.30 vias sitting at
    0.400 mm -- legal (0.15+0.15+0.10) and already on the board. That cost
    Net-(U2A-DATA_30) its escape and put a fresh drill where a reuse would have
    served: 28 vias / 12 dropped / 30 tracks became 29 / 13 / 31.

    The VIA-TO-VIA term is not merely wrong there, it is REDUNDANT. Every
    entry in `placed` is either a via this run created -- already tested
    against this reuse target in `via_clears`'s `foreign_vias` loop at exact
    pairwise sizes (``via_size/2 + fs/2 + clearance``, and
    ``(via_drill + fd)/2 + h2h`` for same net) -- or another pre-existing via,
    whose spacing is the board's.

    TERM 1 (the candidate via against a stub this run emitted) is dropped for
    a different and weaker reason, stated here rather than overclaimed: the
    reuse target's POSITION is not this run's doing, so a stub grazing it is
    a defect of that stub, which is already emitted. Rejecting the reuse does
    not remove the graze -- it only forces a fresh drill elsewhere and leaves
    the graze in place. It is a false remedy, not a check.

    That it fires at all exposes a REAL and separate gap, measured rather than
    assumed: an emitted stub is never tested against a pre-existing via on
    another FANNED net, because `build_base_obstacle_map(nets_to_route=...)`
    excludes every net being escaped (obstacle_map.py:105), so
    `check_line_clearance` cannot see it, and `via_clears` tests only the via
    CENTRE against `foreign_vias`, never the stub. Measured on U2: 5 emitted
    stubs sit inside a foreign pre-existing via's floor, one of them at
    0.0000mm, and in all 5 the via's net is a fanned one. That count is
    IDENTICAL at 715c821 and here, so it is pre-existing and untouched by this
    change -- and it wants its own fix in the stub check, not an accidental
    partial cover for the subset of vias that happen to be reuse targets.

    So with ``adds_via=False`` only the new STUB is tested against this run's
    own output, which is the only copper the reuse emits. A stub shorter than
    POSITION_TOLERANCE emits no track at all (the commit loop skips it), so it
    conflicts with nothing.

    Returns True when the candidate must be REJECTED.

    crowded fine-pitch edge where the *surface* is full (a neighbour pair on one
    side, a foreign track on the other) -- the case the surface fan cannot solve.

    "Foreign" copper is anything NOT on a net we're escaping right now, even if
    it sits on the SAME component (issue #161 reopen): a routed neighbour pair
    and a crossing track are usually on the chip's own other nets, so they must
    block the via even though they share the footprint. Each candidate via is
    obstacle-checked against foreign vias, foreign PADS and foreign TRACKS (the
    track check was the gap that let a via land on a neighbour's trace and short
    it -- issue #161); only the via's own net is exempt.

    Adjacent vias are staggered along the escape axis so two neighbours one pitch
    apart still clear each other. With `allow_via_in_pad` the via may sit on its
    own pad, so its candidate offsets are a MIX: on-pad positions (centre, then
    inward toward the chip) *and* off-pad positions (outward past the pad) -- a
    pad that can't escape one way may still escape the other. Without it the via
    stays clear of the pad body and only moves outward.

    Placement is greedy per side, but if the default stagger drops a pad the side
    is re-tried under alternative configurations -- reversed order, and per-pad
    direction biases (e.g. one leg back/inward, its neighbour forward/outward) --
    keeping whichever escapes the most pads (issue #161 follow-up). The default
    (forward, nearest-offset-first) is tried first, so when it already escapes
    every pad nothing changes. A pad with no clear offset under any configuration
    is dropped. Returns (tracks, vias, dropped_net_names).

    #     skips it for PAD-SEGMENT (`_pad_has_no_copper`, #260); so do we.
    #   * layer scope resolves through `pad_copper_layers`, which expands the
    #     `*.Cu` and `F&B.Cu` wildcards. A bare `layer in pad.layers` misses
    #     both -- zero occurrences in this corpus, but the pcbnew parse path
    #     emits them, so the GUI front would diverge from the CLI one (#722).
    #   * `pad.local_clearance` RAISES the floor: check_drc grades PAD-SEGMENT
    #     at `_pad_pair_cl = max(local_clearance, pair)`. It is per-pad, so it
    #     cannot be hoisted the way the surface fan hoists its `margin` -- that
    #     is precisely why the surface fan cannot honour it and this does.
    # The fourth is a net TIE: `_seg_hits_pad` is net-blind, and obstacle_map's
    # own tie lift only fires when exactly one net is being routed
    # (obstacle_map.py:338-341), so the under-pad path never gets it. Today a
    # tie partner on a fanned net is absent from the map by accident; without
    # this the pad half would turn that accident into a hard block with no lift.

    Generate QFN fanout tracks for a footprint.

        (tracks, vias, failed_nets) - tracks are the segments, vias is empty.
        failed_nets is the deduplicated list of net names whose stubs landed
        too close to another net's stub (endpoint spacing < track_width +
        extension); those tracks are still emitted but flagged as failing
        clearance so the GUI can surface them.

    Cancellation (#621): `cancel_check` is the standard zero-arg cooperative
    predicate (`batch_route` / `create_plane` take the same one), honoured at
    the head of the escape work and at the head of the per-stub clearance loop
    -- the loop that actually costs the time (every stub is checked against the
    obstacle map, every foreign pad and the board edge, then shortened by
    search). It BREAKS the loop, never raises: an exception here dies in this
    package's `except Exception` swallowers. Stubs already kept ship their
    tracks; pads it never reached carry no copper and are NOT added to
    failed_nets -- an unfinished search has measured nothing. The untried pads'
    nets are published as qfn_fanout.LAST_CANCEL_SKIPPED. Passing None (the
    default, and what the CLI passes) is fully inert.
