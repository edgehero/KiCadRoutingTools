"""Flow-aware zone fill model (validator parity with KiCad's filler).

KiCad fills a zone by subtracting every foreign object's clearance from the
outline, enforcing min_thickness (a morphological opening: copper thinner
than the minimum evaporates), and PRUNING isolated islands -- fill fragments
not contiguously connected to the zone's anchored copper are deleted. Our
old zone-credit validator was POINTWISE ("is there room for copper at this
spot?"), which credits exactly those pruned islands: a dogbone via deep in a
BGA field always has a clear ring around its own barrel, but no
min_thickness-wide channel connects that ring to the plane (ottercast: 7
balls graded plane-connected by us, open at fab by KiCad -- and step8's
repair, trusting the same validator, skipped all of them).

This model answers the flow question: rasterize the zone at cell =
min_thickness/2, block cells within (zone_clearance + min_thickness/2) of
foreign copper (the cell-center eroded fill) and cells inside
copperpour-banned keep-out rule areas (#477), label connected components
(scipy when available; BFS fallback), and mark REACHED the components
touching the net's own anchor copper. A query point is fill-credited iff
its cell lies in a reached component.

Perf contract (review requirement: "not much slower / can use more
memory"): built LAZILY per (zone net, layer) only when zone credit is
actually consulted, cached on the PCBData object; a build is numpy-
vectorized over the zone bbox (a full-board plane at 0.05mm cell is ~2M
uint8 cells, a few MB); queries after the build are O(1) array lookups --
cheaper than the old per-query bucket scan.
