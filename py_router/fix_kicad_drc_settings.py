"""Make a routed board's KiCad DRC settings consistent with the clearances and
sizes it was actually routed to, so an interactive DRC in KiCad shows only the
relevant (routing) errors instead of stock-default noise (issue #160).

KiCad stores DRC *design rules* and *violation severities* in the PROJECT file
(``.kicad_pro``), NOT in the board (``.kicad_pcb``). A freshly written board gets
a project with KiCad's stock defaults, which produce noise in two ways:

  1. Constraint floors stricter than the board was routed to -- e.g. the stock
     ``min_clearance`` 0.2 mm, ``min_via_diameter`` 0.45 mm, ``min_track_width``
     0.2 mm or ``min_hole_clearance`` 0.25 mm -- fire on every track/via/drill
     the router placed below them (hundreds of spurious markers). They are not
     real problems at the manufacturing floor the board was routed to;
     ``check_drc.py`` never reports them.
  2. Placement / fabrication categories (courtyard overlaps, solder-mask bridges,
     footprint-library annular/mismatch) fire even though the router neither
     creates nor fixes them.

This script rewrites the sibling ``.kicad_pro`` so KiCad's enforced
**Board Setup -> Constraints / Net Classes** match the per-object minima the
board actually uses:

  * copper **clearance** (``min_clearance`` + Default net-class clearance)
  * **hole-to-hole** clearance (``min_hole_to_hole``)
  * **hole/copper** clearance (``min_hole_clearance``)
  * **copper-to-edge** clearance (``min_copper_edge_clearance``)
  * **min track width / via diameter / via drill / annular ring** -- lowered to
    the smallest such object actually placed on the board
  * Default net-class **clearance** only. The class ``track_width`` /
    ``via_diameter`` / ``via_drill`` / ``diff_pair_*`` are DRAW DEFAULTS (KiCad
    loads them with SetOpt, never SetMin) and are NEVER written: lowering them
    to the board's smallest object was the #842 ratchet -- one 0.127 mm neck
    made the Default class 0.127 and every later run routed at it.
  * non-routing severities (courtyard shapes, solder-mask, footprint/library
    -> ignore; ``starved_thermal`` and ``courtyards_overlap`` -> warning)
    **only with ``--relax-severities``** (#856). A routing step never changes
    what the project counts as a violation unless asked; when it does, the
    previous values are kept under ``kicad_routing_tools.saved_severities``.

**Only loosen, never tighten.** Every constraint is set to ``min(current, target)``
-- it is only *lowered* toward the real fab floor, never raised. So this can
never introduce a NEW violation or silently strengthen a rule; it only stops
KiCad flagging copper the router legitimately placed. A constraint the user
already set looser than the routed floor is left as-is.

Targets come from the routing parameters when you pass them (``--clearance``,
``--hole-to-hole``, ``--edge-clearance``, ``--track-width``, ``--via-size``,
``--via-drill`` -- match what you gave ``route.py``); track/via/drill/annular also
fall back to the smallest object found on the board, and clearance falls back to
the project's Default net-class clearance.

With ``--enable-used-layers`` (OFF by default), it also (``enable_used_layers``)
adds any layer the board actually *uses* -- a footprint, graphic, pad, track, via
or zone draws on it -- but that is missing from the board's ``(layers)`` table,
back into that table in the ``.kicad_pcb``, so KiCad shows the layer as selectable
and stops flagging ``item_on_disabled_layer``. This is the one place the module
edits the ``.kicad_pcb`` (a format-preserving text insert), which is why it is
opt-in; everything else edits only the ``.kicad_pro``.

IMPORTANT: close the board in KiCad before running this. KiCad keeps the project
in memory and will overwrite an externally-edited ``.kicad_pro`` on save/close.

    """Say out loud when the writeback relaxed a MANUFACTURING floor.

    ``origin`` is the floor the board declared BEFORE this chain touched it
    (``kicad_routing_tools.fab_floor_origin``, seeded on the first writeback
    and carried down with the project). Without it this function compares
    against its immediate input, which goes silent the moment a chain has more
    than one step: run 14's R1 announced ``via diameter 0.5 -> 0.25`` once, and
    then R4 added 7 more sub-0.5 vias and R5 added 10 with NO banner at all,
    because by then 0.25 was the input and nothing had "moved". The board that
    shipped had 10 vias under its own declared 0.5 and every instrument called
    it clean. So the comparison is against the ORIGIN, and a step that inherits
    an already-relaxed floor still says so.

    Run-7 finding: two routed boards shipped with their project's
    min_track_width rewritten 0.2 -> 0.0889 and min_via_diameter 0.5 -> 0.25,
    and on one of them 5629 of 5933 segments and 371 of 712 vias sat below the
    board's ORIGINAL declared floors -- while check_drc, board_score and
    KiCad's own DRC all read clean, because every one of them grades against
    the rewritten project.

    The relaxation is not simply a bug: both boards carried KiCad's STOCK
    defaults (0.2 / 0.5 / 0.1), which is exactly the aspirational case the
    clamp exists for, and the routed copper sat at the repo's fab track floor
    rather than below it. The defect is that the tool cannot tell a stock
    default from a deliberate fab constraint -- and when it is the latter, a
    silent rewrite ships a board the fab cannot make, with every instrument
    green. A third board whose author had set 0.127 was never ratcheted,
    because its routing stayed above it; that is luck, not protection.

    So: keep the relaxation (removing it re-manufactures phantom DRC), and
    make it impossible to miss. Counts, not adjectives.

    1. Phantom DRC. The next routing step reads NO project, resolves its floor from the

    routed to, MID-RUN, so anything that grades the board before ``main()``'s
    authoritative writeback sees the floors the board will actually SHIP with.

    Why (#650). The plane finalize's oracle audits ``output_file`` while its
    sibling project is still the one :func:`seed_project_for_output` copied from
    the INPUT -- so the audit fills the pours at the input's *declared* floors
    while the shipped board is graded at the *clamped* ones. Measured on
    orangecrab (``runs_set3``, identical copper, only the staged project
    varied): 57 unconnected links under the input's project vs 46 under the
    written-back one -- GND 19 vs 11 -- and ``rules.min_hole_clearance``
    (0.25 -> 0.0889) accounted for ALL of it, because the zone filler pulls
    copper back from every drill by that rule. The audit's extra links are
    phantom, and kicad-cli is the DEMAND gate of the #648 source union, so they
    become junk welds in the longest leg of the chain.

    COPPER floors only -- clearance / hole-to-copper, and the net classes that
    follow them, which is what changes zone fill. Track / via / annular floors
    are left to the final writeback: measured inert for the fill (the same board
    graded 57 either way with only those clamped) and they want the board's
    scanned minima, which mid-run copper has not settled.

    How big the gap is depends on CHAIN POSITION, so do not read 57/46 as a
    per-step cost: the declared floors survive only until the first writeback
    (down that same chain ``min_hole_clearance`` goes 0.25 -> 0.09 at step 1 and
    stays there, leaving later steps stale by ~1 um -- inert). This earns its
    keep on the first step over a board still carrying its declared floors,
    which includes the ordinary case of a board that arrives with pours already
    drawn, and on the aspirational stock netclass (0.2 declared, routed 0.1).

    ``clamp_nondefault_netclasses`` defaults OFF, unlike the writeback's ON
    (#439): whether the non-Default classes get clamped depends on the caller
    having passed a ``--clearance`` ceiling, which is a ``main()`` fact and not
    an engine one, and lowering them here could ship a tightened class on a run
    that meant to honor them. The Default class and ``rules.min_clearance`` are
    written regardless -- that is :func:`apply_targets_to_project`'s documented
    behaviour and matches what the writeback will do either way.

    Only-loosen, via the same :func:`apply_targets_to_project` the writeback
    uses, so :func:`fix_project_for_output` stays authoritative and can never
    conflict with what this wrote. No-op when the board has no sibling project

    """THE live-board NON-Default net-class clamp: lower each non-Default class's
    DRC-enforced floors to the values this run actually used. Returns a list of
    change strings (empty when nothing moved, or when the board's pcbnew shape
    is one this cannot read).

    Extracted from `apply_targets_to_board` at #782 so both GUI fronts share one
    implementation. The fanout tab is the reason: it prices its decoupling-cap
    pass at the #768 `--clearance` CEILING when the Min-Clearance override is
    ticked, but finished with `gui_utils.update_live_drc_floors`, which touches
    `m_MinClearance` and the DEFAULT class only. So it ran the pricing half of
    #768's GIVEN branch and not the writeback half -- a Wide-class pair priced at
    min(0.4, 0.2) and then graded by KiCad at the still-0.4 class.

    ``targets`` is the same dict `compute_targets` returns; only
    ``min_clearance`` is read. WHY ONLY CLEARANCE: parity with
    `apply_targets_to_project`'s `_NONDEFAULT_CLAMP_FIELDS` -- clearance is the
    one field KiCad enforces PER CLASS, so it is the only one whose stale value
    manufactures violations. SetTrackWidth / SetViaDiameter / SetViaDrill are
    deliberately ABSENT: they are draw defaults, and lowering them overwrote a
    board's declared per-class geometry with a local escape's stub width. Keep
    this list and the CLI one in step.

    ``default_nc`` is the caller's already-resolved Default class when it has one
    (`apply_targets_to_board` resolves it for its own half); resolved here
    otherwise, so a caller that only wants this clamp -- the fanout tab -- does
    not have to. The Default class is skipped BY IDENTITY and by name, and which
    of those does the work DEPENDS ON THE BUILD: probed on KiCad 10.0.0,
    `m_NetSettings.GetNetclasses()` returns the NON-Default classes only, so
    neither guard fires there -- the enumeration simply never offers it. They
    are for the older shape, `bds.GetNetClasses()`, which DOES include it. Stated
    as measured rather than as "the enumeration returns it too", which was my
    own first wording and is false on the build this was developed against.

    Best-effort across KiCad versions (the non-Default enumeration API varies),
    guarded so an unknown shape simply no-ops rather than raising into a step
    that has already placed its copper.
