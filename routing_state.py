# Issue #219: the diff-pair extension of the rip-up cycle-guard is OFF by default.
# The single-ended guard (record_rip_ancestry, commit e3e4b57's queue-level sibling)
# stays always-on; this flag gates only the diff-pair rip/reroute paths. A clean
# per-board A/B (committed vs guard, identical input) showed the diff-pair guard is
# a no-op whenever no diff-pair rip war occurs (the common case, incl. the
# motivating cparti board -- whose +1V8<->B_{n}ON war is single-ended) and a
# sign-unstable butterfly when one does: -13% router iterations on one congested
# config, +12% on another, and one config traded a DRC-clean board for a P/N
# self-crossing on a "successfully" rerouted pair. No measured win, so it ships
# disabled. Kept (not deleted) so it can be graded against a real diff-pair rip war
# if the stress corpus ever surfaces one. Enable with KICAD_DIFFPAIR_RIP_GUARD=1.
