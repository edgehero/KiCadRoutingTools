"""
Under-pad grid escape for dense BGAs (issue #122).

The channel-template fanout confines every layer to the gaps BETWEEN ball rows,
so on a fully-populated array a handful of channels over-subscribe (conflict
cliques far exceeding the layer count) and the deepest balls cannot escape - the
ulx3s 22x22 floors at ~11 dropped balls no matter how channels/layers are
balanced.

The fix exploits a fact the channel model ignores: SMD pads block only F.Cu, so
inner-layer copper can run STRAIGHT UNDER the pad field. Each signal ball drops
a via in its own pad and escapes on an inner layer, mostly as a straight radial
run beneath the pads, jogging into a between-ball channel only where a via or an
already-placed track is in the way. Plane balls (nets the caller excluded from
the fanout) are NOT fanned - they tap their plane through a via (an obstacle here,
not an escape); dense power rails the caller still wants fanned ARE escaped like
any other signal (issue #218). Routing the deepest
balls first (inside-out) lets the interior claim the scarce central space before
the outer balls, which have the open rim, consume it.

A prototype of this model escapes all 210 ulx3s signals on its 4 layers with
plain via-in-pad (no dog-bone). This module is the production router: a small
per-ball grid search (straight-first) over a layered occupancy grid built from
the board's real pads, vias and copper.

    Returns (tracks, vias_to_add, failed_net_names). Plane balls - high-pin-count
    nets the caller excluded from the fanout (or, if no net filter is given, any
    net with >= plane_min_pads pads) - are skipped: they tap their plane and act
    only as via obstacles. Dense power rails that pass the net filter are fanned
    like any signal, so their inner-core balls are not left unescaped (issue #218).

    Differential pairs (issue #182): when `diff_pairs` is given (a dict
    base_name -> DiffPairPads, e.g. from find_differential_pairs), each pair
    whose two balls are routable and ~one pitch apart is escaped *coupled* -
    both balls drop a via on one inner layer, converge to the diff spacing
    (track_width + diff_pair_gap) and run parallel out past the boundary. That
    leaves a clean same-layer, parallel pair of free ends route_diff can pick
    up; without it the two halves escape single-ended and route_diff cannot
    re-pair them. A pair that won't fit a coupled corridor falls back to the
    single-ended escape (still connected, just not coupled).

    Dog-bone mode (issue #128): with `dogbone=True`, inner balls do not drop
    their via IN the pad -- each ball gets a via in the diagonal inter-ball
    gap (a "dog-bone": ball -> short stub -> via), staggered toward the ball's
    escape side, and the inner-layer run starts at that via. This keeps the
    ball-grid positions free of barrels on the inner layers, opening the
    routing streets a via-in-pad grid closes (the human ulx3s escape is 100%
    dog-bone), and eliminates the via-vs-neighbour-ball graze class (#267).
    A ball whose four gap sites are all taken falls back to the classic
    via-in-pad escape, so dog-bone can never escape fewer balls than underpad.
    Coupled diff-pair escapes use each ball's dog-bone site the same way.

    Plane-ball drops (#424 D2): with `plane_drop_nets` (a set of net ids), every
    SMD ball on those nets that the fanout would otherwise skip gets a via NOW
    -- a dog-bone stub + gap via where a gap site is free, else an exact-checked
    via-in-pad tap -- and is NOT routed anywhere: the plane poured later picks
    the via up at fill. This claims the tap while the under-package space is
    still open, instead of leaving the plane step to push a via through the
    finished ball field (the #360 tap-behind-the-ball-wall class). Per-net
    counts are written into `plane_drop_report` when a dict is passed. Drop
    failures are reported there, never in the returned failed list (plane nets
    are not part of the requested/escaped ledger; the plane step's tap search
    remains the fallback).
