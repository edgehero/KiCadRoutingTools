"""One honest tally from route.py's one-or-two JSON_SUMMARY emissions.

route.py runs an end-of-run reconciliation pass exactly when the first pass left
failures. It self-invokes batch_route one level deep on the written board and
prints a SECOND JSON_SUMMARY, scoped to the retried nets, whose failure lists
route.py itself calls "the honest still-open set". Reading only the first summary
counts every reconciliation recovery as a failure.

This module owns that reduction, in two forms:

    merge_summaries(summaries, aborted)  -- from dicts, for an in-process caller
    merge_route_summaries(log)           -- from a log, for a subprocess caller

`route.py --json-out` uses the first (it has the dicts and knows whether the
reconciliation raised, so it needs neither a regex nor a marker string).
`place_route_loop.py` uses the second, because it only ever sees a log file.
Both were the same 110 lines in two places until they were not.

    Per field class:

    * FAILURE STATE (failed_single / open_single / failed_multipoint /
      multipoint_pads_*) comes from the LAST summary, and is exact rather
      than a delta. Every net
      with a nonzero failure term is in the retry set by construction, and the
      sub-run re-derives each retried net's pad counts over ALL of that net's
      pads from the final-board union-find, so the last summary's numbers are
      absolute. Summing pad counts would double-count.
    * EFFORT is SUMMED: both passes are work this run cost the router, and an
      iteration tiebreak should see all of it. Taking effort from the last
      summary would make a badly failing candidate look cheap, since the
      reconciliation pass only re-routes a handful of nets.
    * The pad-pair keys are REBUILT, because they are whole-board in the first
      summary but reconcile-subset-scoped in the sub-run's.
    * Anything else is last-wins.

    `aborted` means the reconciliation raised AFTER printing its summary: it
    claims recoveries the board write may never have committed, so fall back to
    the first pass, which is what is definitely on disk.
