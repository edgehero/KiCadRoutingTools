"""
QFN/QFP Fanout Strategy - Creates escape routing for QFN/QFP packages.

Generic module that analyzes actual pad geometry to determine:
- Which side each pad is on (based on position and pad orientation)
- Escape direction (perpendicular to pad's long axis)
- Stub length (based on chip size)
- Fan-out pattern (endpoints maximally separated)

Works with any QFN/QFP package regardless of pin count or size.

    """Does a candidate via (and its stub) collide with THIS RUN's own output?

    D10. The underpad escape's `via_clears` tested a candidate against the
    board it was handed -- `foreign_vias` / `foreign_pads` / `foreign_tracks`
    are a snapshot taken once, before anything is placed -- and against the via
    CENTRES emitted so far. It never saw the STUBS the same run emitted, so it
    approved vias sitting on copper it had just laid itself, and those escapes
    came back DRC CONTACTS.

    Measured: U2 (QFN56) reported 39 of 46 escapes under
    `--escape-method underpad --allow-via-in-pad` and the gate rejected every
    one as a contact -- while the geometry was fine (a 1.4 mm moat admitting a
    0.7 mm via at all 56 pads, `pad_via == 0`, a real 0.700 mm via placeable
    DRC-clean in U2.43, true capacity 11 of 14 lanes per side). A valid escape
    strategy reported as impossible, and two cycles skipped fanout on it.

    `placed` entries are ``(via_x, via_y, net_id, pad_x, pad_y)``; the stub
    runs pad -> via. A through-via conflicts with copper on ANY layer, so the
    stubs are tested exactly the way `foreign_tracks` is -- the difference is
    only that these cannot be in that list.

    Module-level and pure so it is testable directly: the caller is a closure
    over fifteen locals, and a check this consequential should not be reachable
    only by routing a whole board.

    ``adds_via=False`` is the REUSE case (#479 audit gap 2): the position is an
    existing board via, so this run adds no drill and no via copper -- only the
    bridging stub. Everything about that via's spacing is a fact of the input
    board, not something this run creates, so pricing it as a NEW via at
    ``config.via_size`` judges two vias that already exist, at a size neither
    has, for a spacing this run does not produce. Measured on
    kicad_files/routed_output.kicad_pcb U2 (B.Cu, track/clearance 0.1, via
    0.45/0.25, --escape-method underpad --allow-via-in-pad): with the via terms
    applied, all 7 reuse candidates were rejected on the different-net floor
    ``via_size + clearance`` = 0.55 against pre-existing 0.30 vias sitting at
    0.400 mm -- legal (0.15+0.15+0.10) and already on the board. That cost
    Net-(U2A-DATA_30) its escape and put a fresh drill where a reuse would have
    served: 28 vias / 12 dropped / 30 tracks became 29 / 13 / 31.

    The VIA-TO-VIA term is not merely wrong there, it is REDUNDANT. Every
    entry in `placed` is either a via this run created -- already tested
    against this reuse target in `via_clears`'s `foreign_vias` loop at exact
    pairwise sizes (``via_size/2 + fs/2 + clearance``, and
    ``(via_drill + fd)/2 + h2h`` for same net) -- or another pre-existing via,
    whose spacing is the board's.

    TERM 1 (the candidate via against a stub this run emitted) is dropped for
    a different and weaker reason, stated here rather than overclaimed: the
    reuse target's POSITION is not this run's doing, so a stub grazing it is
    a defect of that stub, which is already emitted. Rejecting the reuse does
    not remove the graze -- it only forces a fresh drill elsewhere and leaves
    the graze in place. It is a false remedy, not a check.

    That it fires at all exposes a REAL and separate gap, measured rather than
    assumed: an emitted stub is never tested against a pre-existing via on
    another FANNED net, because `build_base_obstacle_map(nets_to_route=...)`
    excludes every net being escaped (obstacle_map.py:105), so
    `check_line_clearance` cannot see it, and `via_clears` tests only the via
    CENTRE against `foreign_vias`, never the stub. Measured on U2: 5 emitted
    stubs sit inside a foreign pre-existing via's floor, one of them at
    0.0000mm, and in all 5 the via's net is a fanned one. That count is
    IDENTICAL at 715c821 and here, so it is pre-existing and untouched by this
    change -- and it wants its own fix in the stub check, not an accidental
    partial cover for the subset of vias that happen to be reuse targets.

    So with ``adds_via=False`` only the new STUB is tested against this run's
    own output, which is the only copper the reuse emits. A stub shorter than
    POSITION_TOLERANCE emits no track at all (the commit loop skips it), so it
    conflicts with nothing.

    Returns True when the candidate must be REJECTED.

    short stub from each pad to a through-via just past the pad edge and let
    signal routing pick the net up on an inner/back layer. This escapes a
    crowded fine-pitch edge where the *surface* is full (a neighbour pair on one
    side, a foreign track on the other) -- the case the surface fan cannot solve.

    "Foreign" copper is anything NOT on a net we're escaping right now, even if
    it sits on the SAME component (issue #161 reopen): a routed neighbour pair
    and a crossing track are usually on the chip's own other nets, so they must
    block the via even though they share the footprint. Each candidate via is
    obstacle-checked against foreign vias, foreign PADS and foreign TRACKS (the
    track check was the gap that let a via land on a neighbour's trace and short
    it -- issue #161); only the via's own net is exempt.

    Adjacent vias are staggered along the escape axis so two neighbours one pitch
    apart still clear each other. With `allow_via_in_pad` the via may sit on its
    own pad, so its candidate offsets are a MIX: on-pad positions (centre, then
    inward toward the chip) *and* off-pad positions (outward past the pad) -- a
    pad that can't escape one way may still escape the other. Without it the via
    stays clear of the pad body and only moves outward.

    Placement is greedy per side, but if the default stagger drops a pad the side
    is re-tried under alternative configurations -- reversed order, and per-pad
    direction biases (e.g. one leg back/inward, its neighbour forward/outward) --
    keeping whichever escapes the most pads (issue #161 follow-up). The default
    (forward, nearest-offset-first) is tried first, so when it already escapes
    every pad nothing changes. A pad with no clear offset under any configuration
    is dropped. Returns (tracks, vias, dropped_net_names).
