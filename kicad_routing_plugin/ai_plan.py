KiCad Routing Tools - AI routing-plan integration (issue #40)

Turns /plan-pcb-routing output into GUI state and executes it:
- parse_plan_result(): validate the machine-readable JSON plan
- apply_step_params() / apply_step_selection(): fill tab controls so the
  user reviews each step in the tab they already know
- PlanExecutor: run checked steps sequentially through the tabs' own
  in-process machinery (the AI only plans; the GUI routes the live board)

        _poll_until_idle decides a step is done by polling a CONTROL's state
        (plus the tab's _apply_pending latch); it never touches the thread. So
        in principle _finish could run while a worker was still tearing down,
        and everything after it would race that. This makes the guarantee
        explicit instead of assumed. Bounded and best-effort: a stuck worker
        must never hang the GUI, so a timeout is logged and execution
        continues.

        HONEST SCOPE: this does NOT fix the headless segfault, and in practice
        it is usually a no-op -- the thread has already exited by the time the
        control reports idle. Measured: with the join in place a 1-step replay
        still crashed on run 1. Kept because polling a button to infer that a
        thread is finished is a real (if currently latent) hazard, not because
        it fixed anything. See the crash note in git history for what IS known.
