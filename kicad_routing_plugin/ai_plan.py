KiCad Routing Tools - AI routing-plan integration (issue #40)

Turns /plan-pcb-routing output into GUI state and executes it:
- parse_plan_result(): validate the machine-readable JSON plan
- apply_step_params() / apply_step_selection(): fill tab controls so the

# routing doctrine. It used to, and the copy drifted: it said "fanout first ...
# then route_planes" while calling itself "the #562 pours-first chain", and
# because it is appended AFTER the skill's own text it WON. The plans the GUI
# produced therefore fanned out before pouring -- the opposite of what the skill
# says in four places ("Pour the planes FIRST - before fanout, before any
# routing") -- so the GUI and the CLI generated different chains from the same
# skill. On an 8-layer board (mez_rx) that cost every GND ball its pour-direct
# skip (#424 prints "N pour-covered (no via needed)"; measured 104 of 127 balls
# on a 285-ball BGA), left the plane-drop vias with no pour to land on, and
# handed the pour a fanout-shredded board to flood around.
#
# Anything about ORDER, step composition, or which nets go where belongs in
# .claude/skills/plan-pcb-routing/SKILL.md, which both fronts read. Only add
# text here when the GUI executor genuinely cannot act without it.

            # BIT is not. Since #768 the PRESENCE of --clearance decides whether
            # the cap step caps the net classes and clamps the project, so a
            # step that carries no `clearance` param must run the OMITTED
            # branch -- and with the Min-Clearance override left ticked by the
            # preceding fanout step, it would run the GIVEN one. Unticking it
            # also lands the right flat value: `_effective_clearance()` then
            # returns the board's own Default class, which is exactly what
            # `resolve_pair_clearance(pcb_file, None)` gives the CLI.
            #
            # A step that DOES carry `clearance` is unaffected: apply_step_params
            # ticks the override for it two lines below. That case exists now

            # runs the same pass, so it needs the same rule. Until #780 it

            # is scoped two ways: only the CAP PANEL's controls, and only when
            # the step actually NAMES one of them.
            #
            # The rule is CLI parity, and it is exact rather than approximate:
            # the panel's creation defaults ARE place_fanout_clearance.py's
            # argparse defaults, value for value (2.0 / 1.0 / 0.2 / 2.0 / 3.0 /
            # 1.5 / 30 / 'C,R,FB' / 0.3 / rotate on / edge unset -- checked
            # against repair_fanout_clearance's signature, 11 of 11). So "reset
            # the cap panel, then apply this step's params" IS "run the CLI with
            # exactly the flags this step carries", which is what a replayed
            # manifest is supposed to mean. A recorded `--near-margin 1.5` gives
            # the other ten flags their argparse defaults; inheriting ten
            # leftovers instead is not that run.
            #
            # A step with NO params is the auto-inserted one
            # (_insert_cap_optimization), which is left alone. WHAT IT THEN
            # INHERITS IS NARROWER THAN THIS COMMENT USED TO CLAIM, and the
            # same review measured that too: since the cap knobs joined
            # reset_params_to_defaults, a PRECEDING fanout step's own
            # per-step reset already returns them to the CLI defaults. So an
            # operator's interactive cap tweak survives into a bare cap step
            # only when nothing precedes it -- which in a real plan is
            # rarely the case. That is the right answer for a REPLAY (the
            # recorded run had no operator) and a real change to the
            # interactive path, so it is disclosed rather than implied.
            #
            # SHARED knobs (clearance / grid_step / via_size) are NOT touched:
            # they come from the Basic tab, and the #768 inheritance rationale
            # above is about those.
            # THE DISCRIMINATOR IS "DID THE PLAN SPECIFY THIS STEP", not
            # "did it name a cap knob". An adversarial review measured the
            # difference and it is a real leak, not a nicety: a manifest
            # step converted from `place_fanout_clearance.py --clearance
            # 0.1 --grid-step 0.05` carries params but names no CAP knob,
            # so the name-based test skipped the reset and step B ran at
            # step A's near_margin / cap_prefix / max_passes instead of the
            # CLI defaults. The --grid-step row this branch adds makes that
            # shape MORE reachable, not less.
            #
            # `params` is the exact signal, and it is exact because of the
            # commit two along: _insert_cap_optimization emits
