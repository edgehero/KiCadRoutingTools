def ui_thread_status(status_text, progress_bar, message):
    """Show `message` for work running ON the wx main thread.

    Engine-thread progress reaches the UI through wx.CallAfter, so the main
    loop paints it. Work that runs ON the main thread (the apply phase, the
    fanout, the plane-copper cleanup) BLOCKS that loop, so a bare SetLabel
    would not repaint until the work finished -- the previous phase's label
    stays on screen and reads as a hang.

    Repainting from inside a KiCad ACTION PLUGIN is the delicate part, and the
    reason this is one guarded helper rather than three hand-rolled copies:

      * Only ever touch wx from the main thread. Off-thread callers are
        marshalled with CallAfter instead (never dropped).
      * Refresh + Update ONLY the static text. `wx.Gauge.Pulse()` starts an
        indeterminate ANIMATION -- on macOS that schedules timers and can
        dispatch events re-entrantly, which is exactly what corrupts the
        thread state PYTHON_ACTION_PLUGIN::CallMethod releases on return
        (a PyGILState_Release fatal abort takes KiCad down with it).
      * A latch, because Update() runs the paint path and a nested call from
        it must not recurse.
      * Fully guarded: a status update must never break the work it reports.

    macOS caveat that shaped this function: wxWindow.Update() CANNOT force a
    synchronous repaint on wxOSX/Cocoa -- painting only happens when the run
    loop turns (the wx docs call this out; Andy's report confirms it: labels
    set + Refresh + Update during a blocking fanout never appeared on screen).
    So after invalidating the label(s), this pumps the event loop for the
    UI/paint CATEGORY ONLY, throttled: wx.EventLoopBase.YieldFor(
    wx.EVT_CATEGORY_UI) dispatches paint/geometry events and RE-QUEUES
    everything else -- user input (a stray click, the dialog's close button)
    and timers (the plan executor's poll) are NOT dispatched, so nothing can
    re-enter a handler mid-run. This is deliberately narrower than the plain
    wx.Yield() the tabs use once at run start.

    Escape hatch: KICAD_NO_UI_STATUS_REPAINT=1 sets the label but never forces
    the paint or pumps the loop. The status then lags on blocking phases (the
    pre-fix behaviour), which is strictly cosmetic -- so if a repaint from
    inside the plugin ever destabilises a KiCad build, the label is the thing
    to give up, not the run.

    steps. optimize_caps (and manual edits) relocate footprints on the board via
    SetPosition, but the cached pcb_data keeps their load-time positions -- so a
    LATER signal/diff route step routes around where a cap USED to be, and the
    moved cap's pad then shorts the fresh copper (rp2350: +1V1 vias grazing moved
    decoupling caps C18/C22/C23/C24).

    Re-reads each footprint's x/y/rotation and its pads' absolute positions.
    Pad objects are shared with pcb_data.pads_by_net and net.pads, so updating
    them here updates every view the router consults. Best-effort; never raises.
    Returns the number of footprints synced (0 on error).

    Pads are matched to pcb_data by ITERATION ORDER, not pad number: a single
    footprint routinely carries many pads sharing one number (U6 has 11 pads
    numbered "61" for its GND array, plus 4 blank-numbered pads). Matching by
    number collapses them all onto the first pad's position, deleting the copper
    obstacle everywhere else and letting the router short straight through it.
    build_pcb_data_from_board iterates fp.Pads() once with no skips, so order is
    a faithful 1:1 map. The position math below mirrors that function's
    copper-offset fold (#324/#325) so a no-op sync is a true no-op."""

    * values only ever RELAX downward (min-merge, like the clearance
      ledger);
    * constraints are clamped to the board's ACTUAL minima (the CLI's
      scan_board_minima step): fine-pitch taps route below the step's

    ceiling, priced every class at min(class, ceiling), and the classes must be
    lowered to match or KiCad grades correct copper against a class the run never
    used (#439/#768).

    Pass the CEILING, not the effective clearance. They differ whenever the
    board's Default sits below the ceiling -- flat_hierarchy is Default 0.2 /
    Wide 0.4, so an operator ceiling of 0.3 prices Wide at 0.3 while the
    effective clearance is 0.2. Clamping to 0.2 would ship a class BELOW the
