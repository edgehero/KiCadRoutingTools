"""Routing movie recorder for the GUI (issue #506).

Turned on by the Advanced tab's **Make routing movie** debug checkbox (default
off). While it is on, the live board is snapshotted after every routing step and
rendered into a movie by the shared ``make_movie`` core -- the same movie
``python3 make_movie.py`` makes from a directory of step boards, and the same one
a stress run leaves.

Two scopes, which is the whole point of the design:

* **One routing step** (Route / Route Diff Pairs / Create Planes / Repair Planes
  / Fanout pressed on its own tab) -> that step gets its OWN movie, rendered as
  soon as it completes: baseline board -> the board it produced.
* **A plan run** (the AI tab's *Run Selected Steps* / *Run All Selected
  Steps*) -> ONE movie for all of the steps combined. ``begin_group()`` /
  ``end_group()`` bracket the run, so the per-step renders are held back and a
  single movie spans the whole plan.

The baseline is the board as it stood before the segment being recorded: taken
when the box is ticked, and reset to the end state after each movie, so
successive steps do not re-animate copper the previous movie already showed.

Rendering happens on a worker thread (parsing every step board and rasterizing
frames takes seconds), and the finished path is logged to the Log tab in GREEN
via the dialog's ANSI-aware log.
