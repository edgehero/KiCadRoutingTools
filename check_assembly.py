"""Is this placement physically BUILDABLE? The assembly gate (run-6).

One command, one verdict: the body-overlap channel (blocking = cross-
footprint pad intersections, corpus-calibrated to zero on healthy boards;
advisory = fab/courtyard pairs with class/intent waiver labels) plus the
pad/hole/oob legality echo -- both conjuncts in one JSON.

Needs NO intent to be meaningful (unlike check_floorplan's legality rule,
which skips without a budget): a bare board grades honestly. --intent adds
authored overlap waivers only.

--baseline <board> computes the loop currency: advisory pairs NEW relative
to the baseline board (dense real boards ship hundreds of by-design
courtyard kisses -- the corpus measured 235 -- so the placement fix loop
targets the pairs OUR moves introduced, never a shipped design's own).

Exit codes: 0 = clean, 2 = usage/load error, 4 = a blocking pair OR copper
landing on a KiCad-locked part (see LOCKED-PART CONTACT).
