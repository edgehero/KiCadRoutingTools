"""Are the routing channels open? The lane-ledger instrument (run-6).

Productizes the skill's per-face lane ledger (supply vs demand per escape
face of every fine-pitch part) and the anchor-pair channel widths -- the
numbers the placement gate reads before routing, and the classification
input for "is this failure floorplan-shaped": a face in deficit AT THE
FINEST LEGAL GRID is a placement/floorplan fact no routing parameter can
fix, and its `eaten_by` refs are the fix iteration's move targets.

REPORT-ONLY (exit 0 unless the board is unreadable): the corridor law is
measured descriptive, not prescriptive -- these numbers inform the loop,
they do not gate by themselves. V1 limitation, stated: supply-tap/via lane
consumption is not modeled.
