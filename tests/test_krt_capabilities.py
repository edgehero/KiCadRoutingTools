"""A consumer must be able to prove this clone is the engine it pinned.

A board repository points an environment variable at a KiCadRoutingTools clone
and routes with it. The strongest check available to that consumer has been
"does route.py exist as a file" -- which passes for a clone that is on the wrong
branch, years old, or missing the module the chain depends on. The chain then
runs, prints green, and describes an engine the repo does not pin.

That is the failure a no-fallbacks rule exists to prevent, and nothing detects
it, because every other signal in the run is produced BY the thing whose
identity is in doubt.

`--capabilities` publishes the inventory; `--require` asserts against it and
exits non-zero naming the gap.
