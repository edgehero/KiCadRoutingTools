route_planes' --min-thickness defaulted to a fixed 0.1mm while this repo's own

author declared a wider floor, the pour emitted ribbons the grader then called
too thin: a violation the pour created against a rule it never read.

to 0.2), and falls back to the packaged default only when the board declares
