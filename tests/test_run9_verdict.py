"""The loop gets a stop MECHANISM, not another stop rule.

Every stop rule in this toolchain was already written down -- a 5-lap placement
cap, four routing stop conditions, a budget of 100, "5 consecutive flat" -- and
not one of them had a mechanism. No counter, no budget check, no read of the
ledger that gated continuation; `final` and `stop_condition` were written by
converge.py and read back by nothing. So a run that stopped because the board
was finished and a run that stopped because it was stuck produced the same
artifact, and the difference lived only in whatever the report chose to say.

`converge.py verdict` is that mechanism. What this pins:

  * the four verdicts are DISTINGUISHABLE BY EXIT CODE, so a driver can branch
    on them without parsing prose;
  * reaching `blocking == 0` is the FLOOR, not the finish -- a solved board
    whose quality is still improving gets CONTINUE, because the score is
    lexicographic and quality orders the boards that already got there;
  * only ACCEPTED laps count toward a plateau. A rejected lap is data (it is
    what makes a plateau detectable) but treating it as evidence the half can
    still move would reset the counter on every rejection and the loop would
    never stop;
  * `blocking == null` is not zero. It means a component that was asked for
    could not answer, and it must never read as a perfect board;
  * UNGRADED components do not block DONE -- a corpus board has no spec files,
    so four of nine components cannot be graded and making that fatal would put
    every board permanently in STUCK -- but DONE must NAME them as unexamined.
