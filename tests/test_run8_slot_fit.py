"""The hole-pattern fit, on the patterns real boards actually use.

Two defects, both of which made the fit silently find nothing.

PER-AXIS CONFORMANCE. The grouping demanded `abs(inset_x - inset_y) <= 2*tol`
-- a SQUARE inset. A hole 7.62mm in from one edge and 1.27mm from the other is
just an imperial layout, and it never conformed, so the whole fit returned {}
and the ladder's first vector source produced nothing. Conformance is now
per-axis: the two insets must agree across HOLES, not with each other.

AT-HOME SURVIVORS. A hole already sitting on the fitted pattern was offered
every free corner as a candidate. That is the degeneracy that once shipped two
mounting holes at each other's corners -- mechanically equivalent, and worth
~0.16 of recovery. Its conformance still over-determines the fit; it is simply
not a candidate for being moved.
