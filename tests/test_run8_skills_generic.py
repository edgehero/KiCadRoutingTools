"""A skill states rules, not board names.

The skills are meant to work on ANY KiCad board. Every rule in them has to be
a test on the board in front of the reader -- a detection predicate and a
threshold with its units -- never "on <that board>, <that part> did <thing>".
Measured evidence is what makes these rules trustworthy and it stays, but
anonymised: "a 92-part 2-layer board", not the board's name.

This is a banlist, and a banlist is only as good as its list. It carries the
names of every board in the in-repo corpus (which is where a specific example
would most plausibly come from), the work-dir paths that only exist during an
experiment, and the reference numbers of the experiment runs when used as
authority.
