"""`board_score` splits `unrouted` by SHAPE without moving `blocking`.

`unrouted` is one bucket holding two different failure shapes. A net with fewer
than 2 pads ON the board is refused outright by the router's own
`net_queries.filter_routable_nets`, so no router setting will ever route it and
retrying it in the router is a wasted pass; a net with copper missing for any
other reason is an ordinary routing job. Nothing surfaced the difference, so a
placement-shaped failure was indistinguishable from a routing one until a
routing pass had been spent discovering it (run 10: 13 of 57).

THE PROPERTY THIS FILE EXISTS FOR is the one that makes the change safe to add
to an instrument every recorded ledger already depends on: `blocking` must be
IDENTICAL. That is guaranteed by construction -- `unrouted_shape` never emits
`count`, so merging it into the `unrouted` component cannot touch the number
`blocking` sums -- and construction is exactly the kind of guarantee that
quietly stops holding, so it is asserted here rather than argued.
