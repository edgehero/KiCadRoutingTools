"""A gate must not report a pass it did not measure, and a delta must see loss.

Both defects were found by running the placement skill on a damaged board and
having a watcher re-derive the close-out.

1. VACUOUS SUCCESS. `check_channels --gate` auto-detects fine-pitch parts. On a
   board with none it printed one parenthetical note and exited 0, and the
   close-out recorded "exit 0, no starved face" -- a clean result from an
   instrument that had examined nothing. A component nothing looked at is
   UNEXAMINED, never clean. It now exits 3 and says so.

2. THE DELTA FILTERED BY AN ABSOLUTE THRESHOLD. `--min-demand` (default 7)
   exists to keep the ABSOLUTE form quiet on healthy boards, where a lightly
   used face with no spare lane is ordinary. It was also applied to the
   BASELINE comparison, where it has no business: the baseline already carries
   the design's own habits, so a face that goes from supply 4 to supply 0 is
   new damage at any demand. Measured: a repair closed one part's north face
   (demand 6, supply 4 -> 0) and the gate exited 0 because 6 < 7.
