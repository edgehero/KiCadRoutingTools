"""
Tests for per-net weighting of airwire crossings (issue #458).

net_weights used to scale airwire LENGTH only. At place_route_loop's own
knobs (length_weight 0.3, crossing_penalty 30) the crossing term is about 96%
of the objective, so --failed-net-weight 3.0 raised a length coefficient from
0.3 to 0.9 against a crossing coefficient of 30: on a real board that moved a
typical failed net by about a fifth of one crossing. Each crossing is now
priced at max of the two crossing nets' weights, so a weighted net's whole
contribution scales by its weight, which is what the flag has always claimed.

max() is the rule that keeps an unweighted board untouched, since
max(1, 1) = 1. That backward compatibility is not an accident and is pinned
below: the reported crossing count stays a raw int, and the unweighted code
path is the same integer arithmetic it always was.

The two-pose fixture is built so the weighting flips the optimizer's CHOICE,
not just its arithmetic: with the nudge grid at step=10 inside a 20x21mm
outline, exactly two candidate poses survive board containment, and they
cross different nets.
