"""The options channel: measured, and never a refusal.

Six places in the toolchain promise "say so with the measured number and
stop", and the number was computed in none of them. These are the tests that
the number is now real, that it is honest about being a NECESSARY rather than
a sufficient condition, and that nothing here ever refuses or acts.

The trap this file exists to catch is the one that was already live in the
first draft: `PartEscape` exposes `worst` (a FaceLedger or None) and no
`worst_deficit` attribute -- that name is only a key in its `to_dict()`. A
`getattr(p, 'worst_deficit', 0)` therefore returns the default forever, and
two of these options reported "no face is short of lanes" on a board with 38
of them. So every deficit number here is compared against the emitter's own
dict rather than an attribute that may not exist.
