"""
Tests for how place_route_loop steers the quench (issue #458).

The loop widens --max-displacement 1.5x after a rejected round. Since #455
gave quench a swap cap that DEFAULTS to max_displacement, that widening used
to widen swap teleports in lockstep: a 3mm base reaches 15mm after four
rejections, which is the #430 stranding failure coming back through the loop.
The loop now passes swap_max_displacement explicitly and holds it at the base
value while the nudge radius grows, and it plumbs --no-rotate / --no-swap /
--verbose through to quench.

Nothing is routed here. The routing step, the quench and the writer are
replaced with recorders, so the whole file is a unit test: no router binary,
no board is written, and it stays in the run_all.py --fast lane.
