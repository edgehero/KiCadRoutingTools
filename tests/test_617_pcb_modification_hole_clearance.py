"""Issue #617, engine 2/3: pcb_modification's graze REPAIR must read
min_hole_clearance -- and its bridge/re-bend gates must NOT.

`check_drc` grades copper-to-hole at the board's own `min_hole_clearance`
(check_drc.py:2390) and `obstacle_map.resolve_hole_clearance` (#616) exposes it
to the engines, while every NPTH term in this module was priced at a flat
`max(clearance, NPTH_TO_TRACK_CLEARANCE)` = 0.20 mm. Five sites were candidates
for the fix; #617 changes TWO of them, and this test pins BOTH halves of that
decision, because the difference is measured, not stylistic:

  CHANGED -- passes that MOVE copper by a measured shortfall. Raising the floor
  makes them SEE a real violation they used to miss, and the move is validated
  against all foreign copper before it lands:
      _seg_worst_offender        the shortfall ranking that drives the shift
      nudge_grazing_microshift   the graze DETECTOR + the shift acceptance gate

  DELIBERATELY UNCHANGED -- passes whose only alternative to their single
  candidate is doing nothing. Raising the floor there does not move copper
  somewhere legal, it abandons the repair:
      close_soft_joints          bridges two dangling ends whose caps ALREADY
                                 overlap, so the flanking copper is already in
                                 violation (measured below: the refusal buys
                                 1.5um on a 28.5um violation)
      _connector_clear           same shape -- a stub snap spans at most
                                 1.5 track widths of EXISTING copper
      nudge_grazing_octolinear   all-or-nothing re-bend: refusing it leaves the
                                 net-to-net copper OVERLAP it was repairing

The three "unchanged" cases are kept as CHANGE DETECTORS with their measured
numbers, so a later pass at "finishing the job" has to re-measure rather than
rediscover this the hard way.

Every case is built on a board whose sibling project DECLARES
`min_hole_clearance: 0.25`, with copper at exactly 0.22 mm from the NPTH hole
wall -- legal at the flat 0.20 fab floor, a 0.03 mm violation of what the board
actually asks for. Each changed case is paired with the SAME geometry on a
board declaring nothing, pinning that the change is RAISE-ONLY.
