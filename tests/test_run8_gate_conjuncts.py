"""The wrong-basin gates, inside the engine's own accept test.

E6 and E7 shipped first as checkers, which catch a bad placement AFTER it is
written. The same two facts belong in the accept test, where a candidate can be
refused at the moment it is proposed:

  E6  A locked pose is a decision made outside this toolchain. A candidate that
      lands copper on one has not found a trade-off, it has broken a premise.
      So `locked_contact_pairs` leads the lexicographic gate tuple: nothing
      below it -- not hpwl, not overlap -- can buy one.

  E7  In the exchange stage the engine KNOWS the vector it applied to each
      group. Members displaced by the same k*v keep their relative geometry, so
      they cannot newly touch each other. A new contact ACROSS groups means the
      assignment is not a rigid restore but a search result that happens to
      fit, and it is rejected with the pair named.

Both terms are 0 on a healthy board, which is why the corpus no-op sweep does
not move (66/66 against baseline after this change).
