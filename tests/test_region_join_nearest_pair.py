"""Region-join pair selection and seeding.

1. Vectorized closest-approach is bit-identical to the brute force (#351).
   `find_region_connection_points` measured closest approach between every region
   pair with a pure-Python O(N_i x N_j) double loop over (anchors + subsampled fill
   cells) -- the dominant cost of the region-join MST on big multi-region plane nets.
   It now uses one numpy argmin over the row-major dist^2 matrix per pair.
   The selection MUST be unchanged (the chosen points feed which copper the router
   bridges): np.argmin returns the FIRST global minimum in (i-outer, j-inner) order,
   exactly the brute force's strict-`<` first-minimum tie-break. Pinned against a
   verbatim copy of the old loop over randomized inputs (including ties, empty
   regions, and a daisho-class perf case).

2. The open-space fallback seed must be ON the region (neo6502 GND).
   `find_open_space_point` answers "where is the emptiest cell within 5mm of the
   region's centroid" -- a question about the OBSTACLE MAP, not about the
   region's copper -- and `_try_route_between_regions` fed that point to the A*
   as an extra source/target seed. Being the cheapest cell around, the search
   lands on it, so the strap's end is bare board: neo6502's GND repair produced
   15 such straps (including a 0.1mm one between two regions' open points), all
   correctly rejected by the #479 endpoint verification, which then burned each
   pair's whole try allowance so the real join was never retried. The seed must
   now satisfy the SAME material predicate the join is verified against.

3. A zero-length route means the pair is the same copper, not a failed join.
   Overlapping same-net zones on one layer are labelled per zone, so a patch pour
   inside a board-wide pour becomes a second "region" over identical fill; the A*
   answers with a one-point path. That is merged without copper, not reported as
   an UNVERIFIED failure.
