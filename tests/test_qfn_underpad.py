"""Issue #164: qfn_fanout --escape-method underpad drops a clearing via per pad.

Escapes a fine-pitch QFN diff pair (tigard U3, QFN-64 0.5mm, /USB_DP+/USB_DN)
by dropping a staggered through-via just past each pad instead of the surface
45-degree fan. Asserts both halves escape and the two different-net vias clear.

Uses kicad_files/tigard.kicad_pcb; skips cleanly if absent.

# REUSED via as a NEW one. The reuse target is an existing board via; on
# routed_output.kicad_pcb those are 0.30, and the partners they were judged
# against are also pre-existing 0.30 vias sitting at 0.400mm: legal
# (0.15 + 0.15 + 0.10) and already on the board. Priced at config via_size 0.45
# the test demanded 0.55 and rejected all 7 reuse candidates -- judging two vias
# that already exist, at a size neither has, for a spacing this run does not
# create.
#
