"""The #703 rig, checked by REGENERATING a declared subset (not by shipping 87 rows).

WHY THIS REPLACED A COMMITTED ROWS FILE

The study's 87 rows were committed once, at 276 KB, so `docs/placement-predictors.md`
could not drift from them. drandyhaas reviewed that and asked for the file to go:
the results are regenerable, and he checked it rather than trusting the contract --
`--task esp_prog:authored` rebuilt a row in 4.4 s and every predictor,
`truth.blocking`, `truth.quality`, `argv_sha` and `poses_sha256` matched.

He is right, and the trade is worth stating plainly because it is a real cost.
With the rows gone, the doc's rho table has no automated change detector; it is
the recorded finding, and re-deriving it is an **8.8 hour** job (the sum of
`provenance.total_seconds` over the 87 rows; median 217 s, max 2012 s on
`tigard:perturb-wrong_side`). What is kept instead is a detector on the RIG:
four cheap variants, regenerated on demand, whose predictors and routed truth
are pinned here as literals.

That catches the failure that actually matters day to day -- a change to the
placement engine, the predictor extraction, or the route argv silently moving
the numbers the study measured -- without shipping the artifact.

WHAT IS COMPARED, AND WHAT DELIBERATELY IS NOT

  * `poses_sha256`, NOT the input board's raw bytes. The withdrawn rows file
    stamped `sha256(board file)`, and all four of its board hashes were CRLF
    hashes -- so the gate that checked them was green only on a Windows
    checkout and red on macOS for 3 of 4 boards. `poses_sha256` is computed
    from PARSED footprint poses and is identical either way. (Found in the same
    review; same family as the pre-existing `test_763_kicad_locate` failure,
    pointing the other way.)
  * `routed_board_sha` is NEVER compared. KiCad stamps fresh UUIDs into every
    written board, and CLAUDE.md says so in as many words: "outputs carry
    per-run random UUIDs ... never hash or whole-file-diff `.kicad_pcb` outputs
    to judge determinism". Compare the graded counts instead, which is what
    `truth` is.
  * `seconds` is recorded as measured and never asserted on -- it is a property
    of the machine, and this repo's own doctrine is that wall-clock breaks
    cross-machine determinism.

This test ROUTES, so it is an integration test: about 75 s for the four rows.

#: The declared subset, and the values a correct rig reproduces.
#:
#: Four variants spanning the three generators -- the authored board, a
#: perturbed one, a quench candidate, and a second board -- chosen for cost:
#: every one routes in well under a minute. They are NOT a sample of anything
#: and no statistic is computed from them; they are a change detector.
#:
#: MEASURED, from the run recorded in the pull request. Never predicted.
#:
#: RE-RECORDED 2026-09-03 (#530 decision 3). `truth.quality` moved on the three
#: esp_prog rows and the cause is named: a pad clearance OVERRIDE now REPLACES
#: the class value (KiCad 10, measured by tests/oracle/constraint_agreement.py)
#: instead of max()-ing with it, and esp_prog carries 13 pads at a 0.0508 mm
#: override -- so the router prices those pads as KiCad does and lays different
#: copper past them. `truth.blocking` is 0 on all three, as before; it had read
#: 49/25/34 for one commit because the writeback then stamped rules.min_clearance
#: 0.2193 into the project and KiCad floors an override at min_clearance (the
#: writeback now caps min_clearance at the smallest honoured override).
#:
#:   esp_prog:authored            vias 31 -> 33, copper 336.35 -> 345.52, segs 236 -> 373
#:   esp_prog:perturb-scatter-d1  vias 38 -> 29, copper 377.83 -> 341.07, segs 286 -> 288
#:   esp_prog:portfolio-1         vias 37 -> 32, copper 319.41 -> 347.03, segs 260 -> 270
#:   splitflap_driver:authored    -- unchanged (no overrides on that board)
#:
#: RE-RECORDED 2026-08-30 (second time this day). `truth.quality` moved on TWO
#: of the four rows, and the cause is named rather than assumed: #816's
#: `GRID_TIE_EPS`, which resolves a keep-out boundary cell OPEN instead of
#: letting float rounding decide it. esp_prog's geometry sits on such a tie
#: (track 0.2/2 + clearance 0.2 = 0.3 = 3 x a 0.1 grid), so the router gets a
#: slightly different -- and now position-INDEPENDENT -- set of legal cells.
#:
#:   esp_prog:authored     vias 28 -> 31, copper 320.71 -> 336.35, segs 229 -> 236
#:   esp_prog:portfolio-1  vias 30 -> 28, copper 303.26 -> 299.93, segs 252 -> 231
#:   esp_prog:perturb-scatter-d1, splitflap_driver:authored  -- unchanged
#:
#: The direction is MIXED (one worse, one better, two flat) and `truth.blocking`
#: is unchanged on all four -- no net became unrouted or broken. That is what a
#: boundary-convention change should look like: it perturbs which cells are
#: legal without making the board harder to route. Recorded here rather than
#: smoothed over, because "quality moved both ways by a few vias" is the finding.
#:
#: PREVIOUS RE-RECORD, same day:
#: RE-RECORDED 2026-08-30. `truth.quality` moved on all four rows; both causes
#: were BISECTED before re-recording, because a baseline re-recorded without a
#: named cause hides whatever moved it:
#:
#:   * vias / copper_mm -- `99196134` (#805, "commit the #189 unblock via to
#:     pcb_data when it is kept"). The unblock barrel was never appended to
#:     pcb_data, so for the whole window before its deferred multipoint result
#:     committed it blocked nobody; committing it makes it block, which changes
#:     what routes. esp_prog:authored 30 vias / 342.83 mm -> 28 / 320.71, i.e.
#:     FEWER vias and LESS copper -- better on this repo's own tie-break.
#:   * segments -- `661c88b3` (#811, the collinear merge). It is exactly
#:     copper-preserving in a single route call (measured bit-identical on two
#:     boards), so on its own it moves ONLY this column.
#:
#: One second-order effect is worth recording rather than rounding away: the
#: merge changes how copper is SEGMENTED, which changes rip/restore granularity
#: for later steps of a multi-step chain, so end-to-end copper can shift a
#: hair. Isolated on esp_prog:authored with only KICAD_MERGE_COLLINEAR toggled:
#: 320.69 -> 320.71 mm (+0.006%), segments 241 -> 229, vias unchanged. That is
#: why the copper column moved on rows where the merge is the only new input.
#: RE-RECORDED for #726 (the parser stops losing a footprint block whose
#: reference another block already claims). esp_prog carries TWO blocks named
#: `Ref*` and only the second was parsed, so this board measured as 20 parts
#: where the file has 21. All THREE esp_prog rows moved and
#: `splitflap_driver:authored` did not -- which is the signature to check
#: before believing any of this: splitflap has no duplicate reference, so a
#: change that moved it too would be a different change.
#:
#: `provenance.poses_sha256` moves on all three by construction: the pose set
#: it hashes gained a part. Two of the deltas are worth reading rather than
#: rounding away:
#:
#:   * `esp_prog:authored` -- `pad_clearance_pairs` 0 -> 1. The #697 census now
#:     reaches a part it was structurally blind to; that pair was always there.
#:     `truth` is unchanged (headline 0, vias 31, copper 336.35, segs 236), so
#:     the ROUTE is identical and only the census sees more.
#:   * `esp_prog:portfolio-1` -- `truth.headline` 3 -> 0. The quench candidate
#:     that used to route to blocking 3 now routes clean. The header's
#:     commentary about this row being "the study's headline in miniature"
#:     (23 crossings against the authored board's 53, routing WORSE) no longer
#:     holds for the blocking half, and is left standing above with this
#:     correction rather than quietly edited.

    # times for the same reason: it is the detector the header describes, and

    # quench a seed board at 0.525 occupancy -- below the inference floor --

    # a different placement, not a better or worse fix; the escape landed
    # somewhere else.
    #
    # `esp_prog:perturb-scatter-d1` deliberately did NOT move: `perturb.py`'s
    # scatter kind calls perturb_jitter positionally and keeps the continuous
    # sampler, so its damage model is untouched. That row regenerating
    # identically is the evidence for it.

    # it working. The quench now offers candidates on the board's own lattice,
