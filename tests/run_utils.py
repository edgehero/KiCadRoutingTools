# A NEGATIVE CONTROL THAT CANNOT DISTINGUISH ITS OWN BREAKAGE FROM THE DEFECT IT
# TESTS WILL EVENTUALLY REPORT A FALSE CLEAN. This is the same defect class the
# tools themselves keep exhibiting -- an instrument that can fail two ways and
# reports one -- and it is easier to hit in a test, because a test's failure
# path is the path nobody looks at.
#
# Observed, all in one session, every one reporting "the guard held" or "the
# feature is absent" when neither was true:
#
#   * a negative control exited 1 from a ModuleNotFoundError (the copy under
#     test lived in a temp dir with no sys.path entry) -- read as "the gate
#     refused";
#   * a probe called a function name that does not exist and reported the
#     feature missing;
#   * evidence passed as `<(echo '{...}')`, whose fd is gone by the time a
#     Windows child opens it -- read as "the stage never mentions it";
#   * a section splitter matched the wrong header and reported zero mentions;
#   * an assertion that `--deadline 0` must always produce a partial, which is
#     false on a board with no work to abandon.
#
# `must_refuse` separates the two outcomes. An ACCIDENT (import error,
# traceback, argparse usage, missing file) is reported as a BROKEN TEST, never
# as a satisfied guard.
