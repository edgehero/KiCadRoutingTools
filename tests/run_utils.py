    RAISES when the tool is absent, and that is the whole point.

    Commit ee860796 moved route.py, check_drc.py, place_optimize.py and the
    rest out of the repo root into py_router/ py_tools/ py_placer/. EIGHTEEN
    tests kept spawning `os.path.join(ROOT, 'route.py')`. Python exits 2 with
    `can't open file ...: [Errno 2]` on STDERR, and those tests all assert on
    STDOUT -- so the whole class surfaced as a bare AssertionError with an
    empty message that reads exactly like a product failure. They sat red long
    enough that several of them rotted into FALSE PASSES underneath: five of
    test_soft_joint's ten checks "passed" only because the subprocess produced
    no output at all, and test_457_startup_checks' `returncode == 1` passed
    because ModuleNotFoundError also exits 1.

    So a missing tool must fail HERE, naming what it looked for and where,
    rather than three frames away inside a subprocess. A static lint cannot do
    this job: test_431_board_gates builds `os.path.join(ROOT, script)` with
    `script` a variable, so the bad path is only knowable at runtime. This
    function is the gate.

# path is the path nobody looks at.
#
# Observed, all in one session, every one reporting "the guard held" or "the
# feature is absent" when neither was true:
#
#   * a negative control exited 1 from a ModuleNotFoundError (the copy under
#     test lived in a temp dir with no sys.path entry) -- read as "the gate
#     refused";
#   * a probe called a function name that does not exist and reported the
#     feature missing;
#   * evidence passed as `<(echo '{...}')`, whose fd is gone by the time a
#     Windows child opens it -- read as "the stage never mentions it";
#   * a section splitter matched the wrong header and reported zero mentions;
#   * an assertion that `--deadline 0` must always produce a partial, which is
#     false on a board with no work to abandon.
#
# `must_refuse` separates the two outcomes. An ACCIDENT (import error,
# traceback, argparse usage, missing file) is reported as a BROKEN TEST, never
