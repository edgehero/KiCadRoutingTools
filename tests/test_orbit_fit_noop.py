"""`reconstruct.fit_family_orbits` must be SILENT on healthy boards.

Same shape, and for the same reason, as `tests/test_run8_airwire_refuted.py`:
a detector that fires on ordinary layout is not a detector. The airwire source
was refuted at 6 of 33, and an un-guarded orbit fit is a related failure -- a
near-collinear family of resistors fits an enormous circle exactly as a long
airwire fits a damage vector.

The value of this file is not the 0; it is the MATRIX. Each guard's
contribution is pinned, so relaxing one shows up here as a number moving rather
than being rediscovered on a board somebody shipped. Two of these rows exist
because the investigation that proposed the fitter got them wrong in the
direction that flattered it: it reported the un-guarded rate as 6 of 33 (it is
28) and claimed the guarded rate stayed 0 with `min_inliers` at 4 and 3 (it is
2 and 7). `min_inliers` is a load-bearing guard, not a formality.
