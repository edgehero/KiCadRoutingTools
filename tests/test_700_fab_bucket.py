"""#700 item 1: the fab-floor bucketing is VISIBLE, so a comparison stops
claiming a result it could not have measured.

`_FAB_FLOORS` has two rungs, keyed 2 and 4, so `fab_floor_min(4)`, `(6)` and
`(8)` return byte-identical dicts. That is a modelling limit -- JLC publishes
one multilayer capability column -- and `placement.options.add_layers` reported
it as a routing fact: on rp2350_fpga_eensy_prePlane, 6 copper layers and 121
escape lanes short, it said "more layers buy NO extra lanes on a face".

The issue offers two fixes. Extending `_FAB_FLOORS` with 6- and 8-layer rungs
is declined, on one ground rather than two: `fab_tiers.py` sources its table
from jlcpcb.com/capabilities, which publishes ONE multilayer column, so a
6-layer rung would be a number with no source behind it.

(An earlier version of this docstring also claimed `tests/test_fab_tiers.py`
would force the invention into the open by pinning the ladder per bucket. A
fact-checker disproved it: that test loops `for ncu in (2, 4)` over a
hardcoded table, so a synthetic 6-layer rung passes it UNMODIFIED. A new rung
would be untested, not red -- which is a weaker position for the decline, and
worth saying so.)

This is the other fix: report the bucket.
