"""The negative-control guard, tested against the five real false-cleans.

A check that can fail for a reason other than the one it is testing will
eventually report a false clean. That is the same defect class the tools keep
exhibiting -- an instrument that can fail two ways and reports one -- except it
is easier to hit in a test, because a test's failure path is the path nobody
looks at.

Every case below is a REAL mistake made while building the deadline/render
work, replayed against `run_utils.check` to prove the helper separates "the
guard held" from "my control was broken".
