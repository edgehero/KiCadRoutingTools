"""Regression test for issue #189 problem 2: the via-in-pad escape.

A multi-point single-ended MST edge whose target is a boxed-in fine-pitch SMD
pad used to fail ("no rippable blockers") because the pad was only reachable on
its own (walled-in) layer. The router now drops a DRC-legal via INSIDE the pad
(found with the same local via-obstacle map + fab-floor escalation the plane
repair sweep uses, ae2069 -- the big routing grid over-blocks a via that is
actually fab-legal) and re-routes the edge to that via on an open inner layer.

Repro: routing glasgow_revC `/IO_Banks/IO_Buffer_B/*` boxes in RN-network pads
(e.g. RN4.6) whose MST edge fails on F.Cu but completes via an inner layer.
Without the escape this subset leaves a pad floating (1 FAILED); with it, all
37 nets / 90 pads connect, and the forced via must be DRC-clean.
