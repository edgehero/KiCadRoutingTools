"""Run-12 tool fixes: the fence, the routing banner, and two disclosures.

Five findings, each pinned by the behaviour it changed rather than by the code
that changed:

  Tier 0  The perturbation rig wrote its CONTROL -- the human placement,
          pose for pose -- into the directory the run then works in, and
          `fence_audit` exempted that file BY NAME. The same bytes were a LEAK
          or CLEAN depending only on the filename, which contradicts the
          auditor's own docstring ("this audit ignores names"). Now: a control
          inside the work dir is a leak whatever it is called, and
          `perturb(control_out=...)` puts the control AND the record (it embeds
          `original_poses`) outside the fence in one call.

  1       Every routing tool publishes exactly ONE JSON_SUMMARY, and never a
          second contradicting `incomplete` line after it (run 11). The
          `--deadline` budgets these tools once carried are GONE: no result may
          depend on a wall clock, and the only cancel in the system is the
          GUI's own Cancel button, which reaches the engines' cooperative
          `cancel_check`.

  2       The CMD:/EXIT= banner: exactly one of each per log. `cli_banner`
          promises an `EXIT=` that an EXTERNAL kill never delivers -- a gap the
          harness doing the killing owns, since the tools have no self-budget
          to fall back on.

  3       No grader said anything when a board declared NO floor at all
          (tigard ships no .kicad_pro), so a whole baseline could be measured
          against a fallback with nothing in the transcript recording it.

  6       `check_channels` computed `deficit_finest_grid` per face and surfaced
          it nowhere a caller could read; the gate counts only STARVED faces
          (supply == 0 AND demand >= --min-demand), which structurally cannot
          see a `demand 3 / supply 1` face -- the shape that bounded run 11.
          Reported now, and DELIBERATELY not gated.

    # Be precise about the corroboration, because the first version of this
    # comment overstated it: ONE other instrument agrees --
    # `grade_body_overlap` reports a J2/U3 `courtyard` pair of 6.6mm2. There is
    # NO pad conflict between them (rp2350's single pad conflict is C18/C19,

    # 147.78-149.22), and `blocking` is 0. So this is an advisory-strength
