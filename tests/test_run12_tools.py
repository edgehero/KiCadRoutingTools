"""Run-12 tool fixes: the fence, the routing deadline/banner, and two disclosures.

Five findings, each pinned by the behaviour it changed rather than by the code
that changed:

  Tier 0  The perturbation rig wrote its CONTROL -- the human placement,
          pose for pose -- into the directory the run then works in, and
          `fence_audit` exempted that file BY NAME. The same bytes were a LEAK
          or CLEAN depending only on the filename, which contradicts the
          auditor's own docstring ("this audit ignores names"). Now: a control
          inside the work dir is a leak whatever it is called, and
          `perturb(control_out=...)` puts the control AND the record (it embeds
          `original_poses`) outside the fence in one call.

  1       No routing tool had `--deadline`, so an external kill left no
          JSON_SUMMARY and no exit code of ours. Now each of the three stops on
          its own budget, publishes `complete: false / status: deadline`, and
          exits 7.

  2       ...and only THEN may they carry the CMD:/EXIT= banner, because
          `cli_banner` promises an `EXIT=` that an external kill never
          delivers. Exactly one of each per log.

  3       No grader said anything when a board declared NO floor at all
          (tigard ships no .kicad_pro), so a whole baseline could be measured
          against a fallback with nothing in the transcript recording it.

  6       `check_channels` computed `deficit_finest_grid` per face and surfaced
          it nowhere a caller could read; the gate counts only STARVED faces
          (supply == 0 AND demand >= --min-demand), which structurally cannot
          see a `demand 3 / supply 1` face -- the shape that bounded run 11.
          Reported now, and DELIBERATELY not gated.

    The stacked-footprint warning blamed a netlist re-import for front/back

    this wrong, and all three were live at some point:

      * suppress on "every one is a marker" -- but tested group-wide, so one
        back-side part exonerated an arbitrarily large front-side pile;
      * suppress on "every one is locked" -- but this toolchain STAMPS its own
        locks (seeder.stamp_locked, on place_seed's output), so a pile the
        tools created would be invisible to the check meant to catch piles;
      * suppress on a marker test that never ran (it read `.kind` off a
        namedtuple whose field is `.name`, into a bare except).

    Silence is the failure mode here, so every case below asserts the DIRECTION,
