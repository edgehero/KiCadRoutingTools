"""An edge seat must land ON the board, or not be a seat.

`place_edge` is the one seat in the system that runs neither `pose_ok` (an edge
part overhangs by design, so full containment is the wrong predicate) nor a
clearance ladder. That left it with no containment check of any kind, and three
defects that compounded into a connector placed entirely off the far side of
the board and reported as seated, exit 0:

  A. `_seat_edge` took no exclude set, so an unplaced PILE at the board centre
     vetoed the honest edge poses and the slide loop walked the part along the
     edge until one was "conflict free".
  B. `_edge_correct` drives a SCALAR SUM (`rect_outside_amount` sums all four
     sides) with a SINGLE-AXIS walk, so an along-edge overshoot is a constant
     it can never cancel -- it subtracts it again every iteration and marches
     the part inland past the opposite edge. It ran a fixed `range(4)` with no
     convergence test, returning a diverged pose indistinguishably from a
     converged one.
  C. The along-edge fraction was clamped to a bare [0.05, 0.95], which knows
     nothing of the part's own width.

Measured before the fix, on a staged pile of orangecrab_ext_pll:
`place_edge J2 south` -> pose (170.068, 88.767), `moved_mm 26.17`, seated,
exit 0 -- on a board spanning y 91.52..114.38, i.e. entirely off the NORTH
edge. The same op on the placed board gave (159.909, 112.33), moved 0.55mm.
The fix makes the pile case return that same correct answer.

The fixture is the tracked `kicad_files/orangecrab_ext_pll.kicad_pcb`, driven
through the seeder helpers IN MEMORY -- no CLI, so the routed/unplaced gates
and the board's existing copper are irrelevant to what is being measured here.
It is used because it genuinely reproduces: J2's courtyard is 41.16mm on a
50.80mm edge, so the part is 81% of its own edge and the fraction clamp is
load-bearing. `flat_hierarchy` (the acceptance fixture) does NOT reproduce any
of this -- its connectors are small and far from the pile -- which is exactly
why this file exists separately.
