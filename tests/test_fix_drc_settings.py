"""Issue #160: fix_kicad_drc_settings.py makes a routed board's KiCad DRC
constraints consistent with the routed floors -- lowering them toward the fab
floor (never raising), creating a Default net class if the project has none, and
ignoring non-routing severities -- while leaving the .kicad_pcb byte-for-byte
untouched (so a KiCad-9 board stays KiCad-9).
