"""fence_audit: a ground-truth leak is content, not a filename (run-7 D4).

The hole this closes: the perturbation's INPUT board (the human placement with
its copper stripped) sat in every run-7 work dir. Nothing named it as truth, so
nothing fenced it -- and its footprint poses ARE the human placement.

The four behaviours pinned here are the ones that make the audit usable rather
than merely loud:

  1. a renamed copy of the control is caught (the point);
  2. a work dir with only the perturbed board is clean (no false alarm);
  3. a board PRODUCED BY THE RUN that reaches truth is NOT a leak -- one run-7
     board recovered bit-exactly (d1 = 0.000000) and every downstream board it
     wrote matches the control. Calling that a breach would make the audit fire
     loudest on the experiment's best result;
  4. a board PRESENT AT CREATION that matches truth still is a leak, even
     after the same run.

3 and 4 are the same content and opposite verdicts, so the creation manifest --
not a threshold -- is what separates them.
