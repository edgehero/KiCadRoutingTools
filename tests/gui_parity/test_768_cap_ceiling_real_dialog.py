"""#768 on the REAL headless dialog: what value of `netclass_ceiling` does the
cap pass actually receive, on BOTH GUI call paths?

    python3 tests/gui_parity/test_768_cap_ceiling_real_dialog.py

(re-execs into KiCad's bundled python automatically, like its siblings)

THIS FILE EXISTS BECAUSE THE SOURCE-TEXT HALF COULD NOT CATCH THE DEFECT IT WAS
NAMED FOR. `tests/test_768_cap_clearance_ceiling.py` asserted that the gate
expression mentions a config key and that the key appears once per file. Both
were true of a gate that was WRONG (it read `fix_drc_settings`) and, on one of
the two call paths, INERT (that key is not in the config that path builds). Only
capturing the kwargs the engine is handed, from the real dialog, distinguishes
those.

THE RULE. The CLI switches the ceiling on the PRESENCE of `--clearance`, and
the GUI now carries a value with exactly that contract: `clearance_ceiling` is
the Basic tab's Min Clearance override spin value when its box is ticked, and
None when it is not. Presence IS the switch, on both fronts.

IT MUST BE THE RAW OVERRIDE, not `_effective_clearance()`. That helper already
returns `min(Default class, override)`, which is right for the BASE and wrong
for the ceiling: handed it, a class sitting BETWEEN the Default and the
operator's number gets capped to the Default instead of to the number typed.
An adversarial review measured 22 cap clearance violations against main's 2 at
the default dialog configuration when the resolved base was passed as a ceiling.

WHY NOT `fix_drc_settings`, which the first cut of #768 used: measured, that box
did not clamp a net class at all. `update_live_drc_floors` wrote `m_MinClearance`
and the DEFAULT class only, carried no non-Default clamp, and this tab never
called `apply_targets_to_board`. Gated there, the GUI priced every pair at the
ceiling and clamped nothing -- the GIVEN branch's pricing with the OMITTED
branch's writeback, which is #768 pointing the other way.

PAST TENSE SINCE #782, and the reasoning above is preserved rather than deleted
because it is still why `clearance_ceiling` is the right gate and
`fix_drc_settings` is not. What changed is only the second clause: the tab now
DOES clamp its non-Default classes, through
`update_live_drc_floors(nondefault_clamp_mm=...)` on the inline path and
`clamp_nondefault_netclasses_on_board` on the standalone one, both switched on
the presence of the same `clearance_ceiling` this file grades. That half is
`tests/gui_parity/test_782_fanout_netclass_clamp.py`; this file still owns the
PRICING half, which is the question "what value does the engine receive".

TWO PATHS, and the first cut was correct on one and inert on the other:
  inline      `_apply_fanout_results` -> `_optimize_decoupling_caps(fanout_config)`
  standalone  `run_cap_optimization` -> builds its OWN cfg from a handful of
              shared keys, then calls the same method. The plan executor's
              `optimize_caps` step uses this one.
Both are driven below. A gate that reads a key the standalone cfg does not carry
looks right inline and does nothing where it matters.
