"""Class-2 coverage lint: every CLI main() post-engine finalization pass must
have a GUI counterpart.

CLI fronts and the GUI tabs call the SAME shared engine functions (batch_route,
create_plane, generate_bga_fanout, ...), so a fix INSIDE those is inherited by
both for free (Class 1). The drift happens when a CLI `main()` runs an extra
pass AFTER its engine call -- clean_plane_copper, oracle_reconnect,
fix_project_for_output, ... -- that the GUI must separately replicate (Class 2).
That is exactly how the set11 GUI board shipped 35 plane shorts the CLI board
didn't have: repair_planes.main() ran clean_plane_copper on its
output file and the planes tab never did.

This lint has no gate-able runtime; it is a STATIC guard:
  A. Every known post-pass called in a CLI main() is registered here.
  B. Every registered post-pass in active CLI use has >=1 GUI counterpart symbol
     present in kicad_routing_plugin/ (the actual regression check -- catches a
     renamed/removed GUI counterpart).
  C. DISCOVERY: any symbol from a pure-finalization module (kicad_oracle,
     fix_kicad_drc_settings) called in a CLI main() but NOT registered fails,
     so a NEW CLI-only post-pass can't be added without wiring the GUI.

Pure Python, no wx / no pcbnew.  Run: python3 tests/gui_parity/test_cli_postpass_coverage.py

# through the CLI comes back with its null-length Edge.Cuts primitives dropped
# (KiCad grades each as invalid_outline and slows to a crawl: 656s -> 2.7s on
# pinci), while the same board routed through the GUI keeps them, because the
# GUI mutates the user's open document rather than authoring a file. The twin
# would be gui_utils.strip_zero_length_edge_cuts_board(board), called where
# move_copper_graphics_to_silkscreen_board already is (swig_gui _apply path and
# planes_gui). Not shipped blind: removing footprint-embedded Edge.Cuts items
# through the SWIG object API killed the interpreter in every headless attempt
