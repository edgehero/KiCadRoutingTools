"""A geometry-floor override must not leak from one plan step into the next.

`_effective_geometry_floor` returns the board's Default net-class value when a
floor's override checkbox is UNCHECKED, and the typed control value when it is
CHECKED. That mirrors the CLI exactly: an omitted `--track-width` /
`--clearance` / `--via-*` makes the CLI resolve the board's own value.

`ai_plan._enable_geometry_override` checks the box whenever a plan step supplies
the param — correct — and `reset_params_to_defaults` un-checks every one of them
again (#439, the loop near the end of that method). So the design was right and
the code was right.

What broke it was 80 lines above that loop: `impedance_value.SetValue(50.0)`
passed a float to a wx.SpinCtrl (integer-only), which raises `TypeError` on
wxPython 4.2 — and `ai_plan` CATCHES it, logging "per-step reset skipped". The
reset therefore ABANDONED itself partway, and every control below that line,
including the whole #439 un-check loop, silently kept the previous step's state.

The visible symptom was `test_gui_engine_parity` reporting CLI=1307 / GUI=1308
segments, with 58 GND plane taps at 0.3 mm where the CLI laid them at 0.127 —
same coordinates, 2.4x the copper width — while still printing "VERDICT: PARITY",
because the graded metrics (DRC, unconnected) did not move.

The lesson this gate encodes: a caught-and-logged exception in a reset is
indistinguishable from a reset that worked, so assert the OBSERVABLE state
(what each floor resolves to) rather than trusting the reset ran.

Needs wx; re-execs into KiCad's python.

    that single hard rung -- a board declaring 0.0 gave GUI 0.10 against CLI
    0.20: the GUI drilling twice as close as the CLI on the same board.
