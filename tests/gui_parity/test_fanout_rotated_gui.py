"""CLI/GUI parity for QFN fanout on a ROTATED footprint (PR 633 / 301ee1b3).

This fills a hole the ledger has named twice: **no gate runs a fanout step**.
Fanout is the only routing consumer of `pad.local_x/local_y`, and those are the
one PCBData field the GUI front COMPUTES (`build_pcb_data_from_board`'s
pad-local fallback, live since KiCad 7+ removed `pad.GetPos0()`) rather than
reading from the file. So a bug there is invisible to every existing gate:
test_gui_engine_parity's plan is signal + plane, and the CLI text parser reads
pad locals verbatim and never executes the code at all.

That is exactly how `_global_to_local`'s transposed rotation survived -- wrong
for 620/1079 pads on this very board, and nothing went red.

What this pins, driving the REAL FanoutTab on a REAL headless RoutingDialog
against the CLI's text-parsed engine call, same board, same component:

  1. side classification is IDENTICAL across the two fronts. This is the
     assertion that catches a local-frame bug: the transposed body reported
     bottom 17 / top 3 on this 90 deg QFN-76 where the CLI says bottom 3 /
     top 17.
  2. the emitted copper is IDENTICAL across the two fronts. Note this alone
     would NOT have caught the bug -- QFN escape geometry is built from pad
     GLOBALS, so a 180 deg relabel of a centre-symmetric package moves nothing
     (measured: 104 tracks both ways, byte-identical). It is here because
     fanout copper parity is worth pinning on its own, and because an
     asymmetric or non-orthogonal part would break it.
  3. every escape leaves its pad OUTWARD, on both fronts.

Board: kicad_files/haasoscope_pro_max_test.kicad_pcb, U2 = QFN-76 @ 90 deg --
the in-repo part whose rotation makes the two candidate local frames disagree
(they coincide only at 0/180).

Needs KiCad python (wx + pcbnew); skips cleanly without it. Costs a few
seconds -- no routing, just the fanout engine twice.
