"""The loop stops asking for work it is already holding.

L3 printed three shapes and four measurement commands and asked the operator to
run check_channels, check_reachability and two renders, read the exit codes and
decide. Every one of those measurements is exactly what a defect record and a
route summary contain -- so the stage the whole loop turns on was asking for
work the loop had already done.

The rule this file pins hardest: L3 PROPOSES, it does not decide and it does not
refuse. `--shape` on L4 stays the operator's assertion -- the driver's own text
calls that "the guard that matters most" -- and it must keep costing a
deliberate act. What changed is that the assertion is now made against a printed
derivation instead of from memory, and a contradiction is printed loudly at L4.
