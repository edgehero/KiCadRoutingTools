"""Obstacle-map ref-count balance on churn boards, for all four front-ends
(issues #208 / #309).

Every front-end that maintains an incrementally-updated obstacle map must end
its run with the map exactly equal to a fresh rebuild - any residual is a
ref-count leak (over-blocking that silently costs routability) or an
over-decrement (under-blocking that ships DRC violations). The #309 leaks
(phase-3 tap-via removes missing diagonal_margin; in-progress-via rings on the
persistent working map) only appear under RIP/REROUTE CHURN, so each stage
here is pinned to a recipe measured to actually churn:

  1. route.py     - flat_hierarchy at deliberately fat geometry: forces
                    rip-ups and a phase-3 temporary tap-obstacle window.
                    This exact recipe showed the pre-fix #309 leak
                    (+616 blocked_cells at 5436c08). KICAD_OBSTACLE_AUDIT
                    asserts working == base + sum(caches); the
                    KICAD_OBSTACLE_LEDGER cross-checks per cache object.
  2. route_diff   - lvds_converter_dualclk CLK/DATA pairs, same audit on
                    route_diff's own working map.
  3. route_planes - kit-dev quick chain (/AN* signals, then 4-layer
                    +3.3V/GND planes): the per-net via-placement map audit
                    vs a fresh rebuild. NO churn since #562 -- the pour step
                    defers every via-needed pad to the route step, so it
                    cannot rip; stage 4 carries the churn coverage.
  4. repair_planes - interf_u chain (planes -> U9 fanout ->
                    signal route -> repair): the repair pass runs under
                    TAP_MAP_VERIFY=1, whose built-in asserts compare the
                    shared via maps against fresh builds on every rip and
                    per-tap window.

If a stage's churn assertion starts failing after an engine change, the
recipe needs re-tuning (more congestion), NOT deletion - without churn the
balance check is vacuous. The ONE exception is a front-end that can no longer
churn by construction (route_planes since #562): there, re-tuning is
impossible and the churn coverage must MOVE to a front-end that still rips,
never be quietly dropped.
