"""Blocking-obstacle attribution must distinguish rippable track from static pad.

The defect this guards (test-board run 5, journal [9]/[10] and the audit's item
2): the stuck-probe diagnostic merged segment, via and pad blocking into one
count per net, so a net whose only remaining blocking copper was its unrippable
PAD kept being cited after its tracks were ripped (GPIO7's residue), and the
decisive 1-3 cell track wall ranked under large-perimeter bystanders. Now
_identify_blocking_obstacles reports (name, total, track_count, pad_count), the
print says which kind blocks, and the TRACK owners are stashed on
pcb_data._stuck_wall_blame for the net's own phase-3 rip cascade, where
validator-named blockers sort ahead of every frontier-inferred tier.
