"""The provenance audit, attacked the way a hand script would attack it.

The case that matters is the one run 19 produced: a board whose poses are
genuinely BLIND -- nothing read the control -- and genuinely NOT the engine's.
`fence_audit` says CLEAN on that, correctly, because it asks a different
question. This must not.

Five cases, and the third is the load-bearing one:

  1. a run through a registered lever            -> CLEAN (0)
  2. a write through the funnel with no lever    -> refused BEFORE the write
  3. a hand edit of `(at ...)` as RAW TEXT       -> VIOLATION (4)
  4. no ledger, and poses MOVED                  -> VIOLATION (4)
  5. no ledger, and nothing moved                -> UNPROVEN (5)

Case 3 is why the audit reconciles the BOARD rather than reading the log: a
script that never imports the writer leaves no row to be missing, and an audit
that trusted the ledger would report CLEAN on a board it never authored.

Cases 4 and 5 are the same check split on the board's own evidence, and an
audit found them merged the wrong way: `audit()` returned UNPROVEN whenever
there were no rows, WITHOUT looking at the poses, which swallowed exactly the
run-19 case the instrument was built for -- a purely hand-placed board has no
ledger BECAUSE nothing engine-side ran, and it came back "I cannot prove it"
instead of "I proved it false". Runs predating the instrument are still
protected, by the earlier manifest check: a work dir nobody staged returns
UNPROVEN before the ledger is consulted at all.

The last block is the one that would have caught the whole thing being inert:
it ARMS a regime and runs a real CLI. Nothing called `declare_lever` outside
this file, so every real run was UNPROVEN, and arming a regime by hand made
`place_optimize.py` raise -- it is in LEVER_REGISTRY but declared nothing, so
the gate refused the engine itself.
