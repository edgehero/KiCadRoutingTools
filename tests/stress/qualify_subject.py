"""Is this board a usable subject for a perturbed-corpus run? Answer before staging.

    python3 -X utf8 tests/stress/qualify_subject.py BOARD [BOARD ...] [--draws 5]

Run 14 chose castor_pollux because it was the largest set-1 board no run had
used. That is not a qualification. The draw it got was clipped to 0.100 mm, the
board stayed perfectly legal, and an hour of chain time proved that an
undamaged board was undamaged. Nothing in the rig could have told anyone in
advance, because nobody asks the question this script asks.

Three outcomes are possible and only one of them is a subject:

  REJECT  the rig cannot damage this board. Draws clip to nothing, so
          `recovery` and `home /N` will read near-perfect no matter what any
          placement search does or does not do.
  WEAK    the dose lands, but the copper-free gates stay clean. The damage is
          real and invisible to every instrument the placement half owns, so a
          repair loop has nothing to aim at and nothing to verify against.
  GOOD    the dose lands AND the gates fire. Now a placement run can fail, and
          a placement run that fails is the only kind that can succeed.

This is deliberately CHEAP: it perturbs to a temp dir and grades copper-free,
so it costs seconds per draw instead of the hour a full chain costs. It routes
nothing. The routability question ("does the damaged board actually fail to
route, and does the original succeed") is the expensive half and stays a manual
step; see tests/stress/RUNBOOK.md.

It prints AGGREGATES ONLY -- rates and medians over the draws -- and never the
kind, block, seed or direction of any individual draw. So it is safe to run on
a board you intend to stage blind afterwards, which is the whole point.
