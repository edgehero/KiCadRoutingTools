"""Convert a stress-test redo_commands.sh manifest into a GUI plan JSON.

The AI tab's Load button accepts the output, so a recorded stress chain
can be replayed through the GUI plan executor without any LLM run:

    python3 tests/stress/manifest_to_plan.py runs_set1/<board>/redo_commands.sh plan.json
    python3 tests/stress/manifest_to_plan.py runs_set1/<board>/redo_commands.sh -o plan.json

Maps each routing command to a plan step (action + nets/pairs/assignments +
params). Since the GUI accepts ANY snake_case option name in params, every
recognized --flag value is carried over (--max-iterations, --max-ripup,
--grid-step, ...). Check/grade commands and unknown tools are skipped with a
note. Only the file-dependency chain to the FINAL board is emitted (retries
that were superseded are dropped), mirroring redo_stress_test's pruning.
