"""Replay whole stress-test SETS in the cloud, keep the routed boards, and A/B
them against an existing baseline wave.

    python3 tests/stress/cloud_replay_sets.py --sets set10-set19

`ab_replay_grade.py` replays a set locally and grades it; `modal_sweep/` fans
(arm x board) tasks onto rented cores. This driver is the missing third thing:
a NO-PARAMETER-CHANGE replay of the current code across many sets, which keeps
the finished `.kicad_pcb`/`.kicad_pro` and then compares to a baseline. One arm,
no overrides -- the question is not "what does this knob do" but "what does the
CURRENT engine do to these 150 boards, versus the last time we looked".

Six stages, run in order by default; pick with --only:

  plan      discover boards, price the run, check preflight. SPENDS NOTHING.
  upload    push any sets the corpus volume is missing (idempotent)
  run       the cloud replay, artifact-keeping ON
  harvest   pull rows + boards into a local wave dir shaped like an
            ab_replay_grade wave, so --compare AND --regrade both work on it
  baseline  build the baseline from the ORIGINAL recorded runs, re-graded today
  compare   per-set + aggregate A/B

Three things this is careful about, all of which have burned this repo before:

1. **The kept board travels with its `.kicad_pro`.** The project carries the DRC
   floor the chain actually routed to. A bare `.kicad_pcb` re-grades against the
   stock netclass and manufactures phantom sub-floor violations on correct copper
   (#441). The container-side copy in modal_app.py takes every sibling
   (.kicad_pro/.kicad_dru/.kicad_prl) plus the manifest.

2. **The baseline is the recorded run itself, not an archived wave.** The corpus
   gets RE-RECORDED. Sets 10-19 were, after the #562 pours-first reshape: the
   2026-07-28 `ab_main_0728a` wave replayed a `route -> planes -> repair` chain,
   while today's manifests run `planes -> route` with the repair absorbed --
   all 150 boards produce a different final output than that wave recorded. A
   board-for-board diff against it therefore mixes a different recorded PLAN in
   with the engine delta and cannot separate the two. The recorded run dir holds
   the very boards the manifest we are replaying produced, so `--baseline
   recorded` (the default) compares like with like. Pointing --baseline at a wave
   dir still works, but preflight refuses it when the chains disagree unless you
   pass --allow-chain-mismatch.

3. **Graders drift, so the baseline is re-graded, never read off an old table.**
   `--baseline recorded` re-scores the recorded boards with TODAY's grader, which
   is what makes a delta attributable to the engine. The recorded runs are
   symlinked into a scratch wave rather than copied or graded in place -- the
   corpus is not ours to rewrite, and regrade() overwrites summary.json in
   whatever directory it is given.

The arm name carries the source commit, so resuming re-uses banked rows only
within one commit; changing the code forces a real re-run instead of silently
mixing two engines into one table.
