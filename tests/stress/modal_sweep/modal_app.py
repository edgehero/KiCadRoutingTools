"""Modal app: fan a routing-parameter sweep across the stress corpus.

    modal run tests/stress/modal_sweep/modal_app.py \
        --arms tests/stress/modal_sweep/arms.example.json \
        --sets set1,set2,set3,set4,set5,set6,set7,set8,set9,set10

ONE TASK = ONE (arm, board). That granularity is the whole point: an arm run as
a single task is ~9 CPU-hours SERIAL, so 100 of those in parallel still take
9 hours. Fanning out to board level makes the wall-clock floor the single
longest BOARD (tens of minutes) instead.

Measured on sets 1-10 (see sweep_lib.load_cost_table for provenance):
  one arm ~8.6 CPU-h  ->  100 arms ~864 CPU-h / 15,000 tasks
  500 concurrent cores ~1.7 h   |   ~1,730 cores reaches the floor

Memory: ONE small tier (1 GB) for everything -- Modal bills max(reserved,
used), so reservations only add cost while burst covers real peaks (p90
5.2 GB tasks complete fine; measured 0.3% over the pure-usage floor). The
8 GB tier is opt-in OOM insurance via KICAD_SWEEP_BIG_BOARDS; see
sweep_lib's tier note for the 414-task measurement behind this.

Prerequisites and known-unverified bits are in README.md. Notably this file has
NOT been executed against Modal's API from this repo -- pin `modal` per the
README and expect to adjust image-builder method names if you are on an older
client.
