"""Replay a stress-test board run deterministically, with no LLM (issue #132).

The original board run is driven by an LLM agent following RUNBOOK.md, but every
routing/fanout/plane/check command goes through tests/stress/run_limited.sh,
which records each command (fully quoted argv + the cwd it ran in) to a manifest
(default <run-dir>/redo_commands.sh). This script replays that manifest to
reproduce the exact final board in seconds with no API calls -- which makes runs
reproducible and lets an engine change be A/B'd cleanly (replay the same manifest
with the change on vs off).

By default the replay is PRUNED to the file-dependency chain that produces the
final board (issue #231): the agent's superseded retries (a route command it ran
5x, only the last feeding downstream) and dead-end branches (an output nothing
consumes) are skipped. This is much faster and deterministic -- each kept command
re-reads its own input board, so dropping the overwritten writes can't change its
result. Pass --verbatim to replay every recorded command literally.

Usage:
  redo_stress_test.py <manifest> [--remap OLD:NEW ...] [--verbatim] [--skip-checks] [--dry-run]

--remap rewrites a path prefix in every argument, so a run whose intermediates
were written with absolute paths under one run dir can be replayed into a fresh
directory (the source board, referenced by its own absolute path, still resolves):
  redo_stress_test.py runs_set1/ottercast/redo_commands.sh \
      --remap /...kicad_stress_test/runs_set1/ottercast:/tmp/redo_A

    - Forward pass tracks `producer[board] = last command index that wrote it`, so

      never-consumed dead ends like `*_retry`) fall out.
    - A check command is kept only if every board it reads is still produced by
      the kept chain or is an external/seeded input (never produced by any
      command) -- so we never check a board no kept command makes.

    Returns (keep:set[int], info:dict) where info has final_index, final_board,
