"""Audit a perturbed-corpus work dir for GROUND-TRUTH LEAKS, by content.

A recovery experiment measures how close a repaired placement lands to the
original. That number is only meaningful if the tools never saw the original.
The protocol fences the obvious carriers by NAME -- the control board, the
perturbation record, the human reference -- and a run-7 watcher found the hole
that naming leaves open:

    the STRIPPED board (the human placement with its copper removed) sat in
    every work dir. It is the perturbation's INPUT, so nobody thought of it as
    truth. Its footprint poses ARE the human placement, exactly.

Naming cannot close that hole, because the next carrier will have a different
name (a `.bak`, a `board_orig.kicad_pcb`, a candidate copied out of an archive).
So this audit ignores names and asks the only question that matters:

    does any board in this work dir carry the control's poses?

Two modes, because the same content means opposite things before and after a run:

  --mode create   Run at work-dir creation, BEFORE any tool touches the board.
                  Every board here is an INPUT. Any board whose poses match the
                  control (other than the explicitly allowed carriers) is a
                  leak -> exit 4. Writes `.fence-manifest.json` recording the
                  files present and their hashes.

  --mode audit    Run at watcher time, AFTER the run. A board matching the
                  control now has two possible causes, and the manifest tells
                  them apart:
                    * present at creation  -> LEAK (it was an input)
                    * created by the run   -> RECOVERED, which is the experiment
                      succeeding, not a breach (a perfect reconstruction lands
                      exactly on truth -- one run-7 board did, at d1 = 0.000000)
                  Exit 4 only for the first kind.

Match is on the pose set, not on file bytes: copper, UUIDs, netclasses and
zone fills all differ between a stripped board and its control while the
placement is identical.

Usage:
    python3 -X utf8 tests/stress/fence_audit.py --control C.kicad_pcb \\
        --workdir wk/run8/<board>/ --mode create
    python3 -X utf8 tests/stress/fence_audit.py --control C.kicad_pcb \\
        --workdir wk/run8/<board>/ --mode audit [--json]

Exit codes: 0 clean, 2 usage/IO problem, 4 leak found.

# control under any other name was reported, the control itself was not --
# while `perturb()` wrote it into the output directory by default, so the most
# likely carrier of all was the one carrier this audit ignored. That
# contradicts the docstring above ("Naming cannot close that hole ... So this
# audit ignores names"), and a name-based exemption for the single most likely
# carrier is exactly the hole the module exists to close. A control INSIDE the
# work dir is now a LEAK, which is what this module says it believes.
#
# The legitimate cases are still covered: `control_real` (below) never reports
# the audit's OWN reference, and `--allow` remains for a caller that genuinely
# means it.
#
# `*.perturb.json` is inert here -- `scan()` only walks `.kicad_pcb` -- and is
# kept as the declaration it is. NOTE that the record carries `original_poses`,
# so it is ground truth too; keep it out of the work dir for the same reason.
