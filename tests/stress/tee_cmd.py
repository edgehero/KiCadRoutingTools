"""Instrumentation ONLY: run a command, tee it, record start/end/exit.

This exists because per-command timings are NOT recoverable after the fact.
`loop_driver.log` writes its `t` AFTER the stage function returns, so it
timestamps completions rather than start/end pairs -- and it logs only the
driver's own advisory invocations, never the placement/routing tool
subprocesses run in response to that advice. Without a record kept at call
time, "the three slowest individual tool invocations with their commands" has
no honest answer but "not recoverable". Run 21 hit exactly that and wrote this
wrapper into its work dir mid-run; it is promoted here so the next run can
just use it.

It writes NO poses and NO copper, reads no board, and takes no decisions. Say
so in the journal and to the cheat watcher anyway: a wrapper around the tools
is the shape a hand-rolled pose writer would take, so what it does is bounded
here and every argv it ever ran is in `cmd_timing.jsonl`.

    python3 -X utf8 tests/stress/tee_cmd.py [--workdir DIR] <label> -- <cmd> [args ...]

Appends one JSON row per invocation to `<workdir>/cmd_timing.jsonl` and tees
combined output to `<workdir>/logs/<label>.log` (also echoed to this process's
stdout so the caller sees it live). `--workdir` defaults to this file's own
directory, which is what a copy dropped into the work dir wants.
