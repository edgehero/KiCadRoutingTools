"""Normalize + strip routing for ONE set-2 board, in a single pcbnew process.

pcbnew segfaults if you process several boards in one process, so this script
takes exactly one (src, dst) pair as argv and is invoked once per board by
prep_set2.sh. It LoadBoard()s the raw GitHub file (normalizing format on save),
strips tracks/vias/copper pours, rebuilds Edge.Cuts as chained segments, drops
non-copper/non-edge graphics, and sets all copper layers to 'signal' so
kicad_parser sees them. Mirrors tests/stress/strip_routing.py.

Run with KiCad's bundled Python:
  /Applications/KiCad/KiCad.app/Contents/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/Current/bin/python3 prep_set2.py <src.kicad_pcb> <dst.kicad_pcb>

    KiCad flags each one as `invalid_outline` ("segment has null or very small
    length: 0 nm") AND grinds on the malformed outline: on pinci, 335 of them
    (12 board-level, 323 inside footprints) made `kicad-cli pcb drc` take
    **656 seconds**; with them removed the same DRC takes **2.7 seconds**, a
    ~280x speedup, and the real findings are unchanged (199 phantom
    invalid_outline vanish; shorting_items 8->8, solder_mask_bridge 16->16,
    unconnected 101->101, all other violations byte-identical).

    Deleting them cannot change the board shape -- a segment from a point to
    itself draws nothing and mills nothing. This is deliberately ONLY the
    zero-length class: tests/stress/fix_outline_gaps.py also culls open
    fragments and bridges gaps, which on pcie_test_edge and kbic65 made DRC
    WORSE (invalid_outline 4->6 and 3->48), and `--max-bridge 0` deletes the
    fragments instead of bridging them, which wiped kbic65's outline entirely.
    Those repairs stay opt-in and hand-verified; this one is safe to run on
    every board.

    Done as a TEXT pass on the saved file, deliberately: most of pinci's
    degenerate primitives live INSIDE footprints, and removing those through
    the SWIG object API (`FOOTPRINT.Remove`) kills the interpreter with no
    traceback -- prep_set2 then writes nothing at all. Editing the s-expression
    is both safer and exactly the transformation verified on the corpus.
