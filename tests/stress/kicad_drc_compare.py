"""Cross-check check_drc.py against KiCad's own DRC engine (issue #316).

check_drc.py is the grading authority for the whole stress methodology, so its
accuracy is load-bearing. Per board this runs `kicad-cli pcb drc --format json
--severity-error --refill-zones` (KiCad grades at the board's OWN .kicad_pro
rules -- the clearance ledger writes the routed floors there, so the two
engines see the same constraints), filters both sides to the COPPER-CLEARANCE
classes they both check, then matches items by net pair + location and
classifies every discrepancy:

  * MATCHED        -- same net pair within 0.5 mm: agreement.
  * KICAD-ONLY     -- check_drc false negative (the dangerous direction;
                      e.g. the butterstick shorting_items under-classification).
  * CHECKDRC-ONLY  -- check_drc phantom (over-report) OR a class KiCad cannot
                      see (KiCad 10 net-unifies touching copper, so it is
                      structurally blind to overlaps it merged into one net).

Known-benign asymmetries filtered out:
  * KiCad classes we deliberately do not grade (annular width, courtyard,
    silkscreen, starved thermals, text/edge, footprint checks, ...).
  * KiCad "unconnected_items" (that is check_connected's job, not check_drc's).
  * check_drc warnings (same-net copper classes + sub-coincidence gaps) --
    KiCad permits same-net overlap outright.

Graded SEPARATELY (#406, never matched against check_drc): KiCad's
`connection_width` min-copper-web class. The checker is OFF by default
(min_connection 0, warning severity), so _staged_copy stages the constraint
(author-set min_connection kept, else the project's min_track_width) and
lifts the severity; the count is reported as kicad_connection_width (None =
not graded -- no recorded floor). check_drc has no counterpart by design:
the flagged artifact lives in KiCad's own float-borderline web measurement.
