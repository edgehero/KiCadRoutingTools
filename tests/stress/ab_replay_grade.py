"""Replay a whole stress-test set into a fresh wave dir and grade it -- the A/B
harness on top of redo_stress_test.py (single-manifest replay).

`redo_stress_test.py` replays ONE board's recorded command manifest. This driver
replays every board in a set in parallel, then grades each board's *final* board
for DRC (at the route step's actual --clearance) and connectivity, and writes a
JSON summary. Run it once per code version ("wave") to A/B an engine change.

Two modes:

  # Grade one wave (the working tree decides which code runs):
  ab_replay_grade.py --set ~/Documents/kicad_stress_test/runs_set3 \
                     --out ~/Documents/kicad_stress_test/ab_run/old --label old

  # Compare two wave summaries:
  ab_replay_grade.py --compare .../old/summary.json .../new/summary.json

Typical A/B recipe (the engine change is uncommitted in the working tree):

  git stash push file1.py file2.py            # baseline = HEAD
  ab_replay_grade.py --set runs_set3 --out ab/old --label old
  git stash pop                               # candidate = HEAD + change
  ab_replay_grade.py --set runs_set3 --out ab/new --label new
  ab_replay_grade.py --compare ab/old/summary.json ab/new/summary.json

Notes / gotchas (see memory: rerun-stress-boards, grade-drc-at-routed-clearance):
- Manifests reference tools by ABSOLUTE repo path, so a replay always runs
  whatever is checked out -- the two waves MUST be sequential (shared git state),
  but boards WITHIN a wave run in parallel.
- A board whose chain breaks (e.g. a diff pair fails -> route_diff writes no
  output) reports chain_complete=False and is excluded from the DRC/conn
  comparison. Compare only counts boards complete in BOTH waves.
- DRC is graded at each board's own routed --clearance, parsed from its manifest.

    The total is `Checking N ... nets` PLUS the unrouted ones, and the two must be
    added or the denominator moves with the result. check_connected's "Checking N
    routed nets" counts only nets that ended up with copper -- its net selection is
    literally `(net_id in segments_by_net or net_id in vias_by_net) and net_id in
    pads_by_net`. A net an arm fails to route at all therefore has no copper, drops
    OUT of that count, and is then reported separately under "Unrouted nets (M)".

    Two consequences, both of which have already cost real analysis time:

    * The same board reports a DIFFERENT net total per arm, which reads as
      nondeterminism in a checker that is deterministic (butterstick: 310 / 314 /
      316 / 316 across four arms of an identical 16-step chain -- all of them 317
      once the unrouted nets are added back). An A/B that pairs boards on "same
      net total" then discards exactly the congested boards, because those are the
      ones with unrouted nets. On the #590 sets 1-10 wave that dropped 40 of 103
      boards, which carried ~85% of all the incompleteness.
    * The failing nets were subtracted from the numerator while being excluded
      from the denominator, so completion % was computed over the wrong base and
      the old `min(total, ...)` clamp existed only to stop that inconsistency from
      producing a negative percentage.

    Residual: a ONE-pad net counts in `Checking` when it happens to pick up copper
    (a plane tap) but never appears under "Unrouted nets", which grades nets of >=2
    pads. That leaves a rare +-1 that no arithmetic here can recover -- it needs a

    RUN BEING RECORDED, usually at a tighter clearance or width. That makes the
    board a biased A/B subject, and the bias runs one way -- against change:

      * the BASELINE replays the recorded run deterministically, so the rescue
        lands exactly on its failures and the board finishes clean;
      * any arm that routes differently fails a DIFFERENT net, which the frozen
        list never retries, so its failure ships while nets that are fine get
        retried.

    authored AFTER seeing what failed; only in replay is it pinned to one arm's
    failure set. Measured on the #590 sweeps, boards that are nearly clean at
    baseline BECAUSE of such a rescue punish every arm (sets 11-20: +2..+8 per
    arm across 22 boards holding 2 baseline failures; sets 1-10: +3..+6), while
