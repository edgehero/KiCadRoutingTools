"""Stage a BLIND perturbed subject: damaged board here, truth over there.

    python3 -X utf8 tests/stress/stage_blind.py SRC.kicad_pcb WORKDIR TRUTHDIR

The run may open WORKDIR/board.kicad_pcb and nothing else. TRUTHDIR gets the
control, the perturbation record and the draw, and is not read until the board
is frozen. Pair it with `fence_audit.py --mode create` immediately afterwards.

Disclosure discipline, tightened against the leaks earlier runs found:

  * The writer's own "Modified N footprint positions" line is a dose/block
    tell, so every call runs with stdout captured and discarded.
  * Run 10 disclosed `PERTURBED BLOCK N` because its report's `home /N`
    denominator needed it, and a watcher correctly called that a leak: a
    `swap` draw unions two disjoint blocks and so reports a distinctly larger
    N than the other kinds. This script discloses NOTHING about the block. The
    denominator is read from the record at AUDIT time, when the fence is
    already down; the run itself is scored on the routed outcome, which needs
    no truth at all.
  * There is deliberately NO redraw gate. Run 10 used `home_frac <= 0.20`,
    an asymmetric filter that bites mainly on `scatter` and is therefore
    itself informative about the kind.

THE DOSE IS SCALED TO THE BOARD, and this file used to only claim that.
The previous version called `placement.perturb.max_feasible_dose(pcb)` with one
positional argument against a signature of `(state, members, u, *, grid_step,
dose_cap, ...)`. Binding failed on ARITY, before any board data was touched --
so the `except` was not a guard, it was the ONLY path, and a hard-coded 30.0 mm
was the scale for every board on earth. The docstring's "a band of the board's
own max feasible dose" was not unverifiable; it was always false.

It cannot be fixed by correcting the arity either: `max_feasible_dose` answers
"how far can THIS block travel along THIS direction, up to dose_cap" -- it is
bounded by the cap you pass, so it cannot be used to DERIVE a dose, and it
needs a block and a direction that do not exist until after the draw. There is
no board-maximum mode to call.

So the scale comes from a real board property instead: the outline's smaller
span, which is what actually bounds how far a part can move and still be on
the board. `perturb()` independently clips whatever is asked for
(`on_overflow='clip'`), and the APPLIED dose is recorded in the record as
`max_feasible_dose_mm` / `clipped` -- so the truth dir holds what landed, not
what was requested.

AND THE APPLIED DOSE IS NOW CHECKED, which is the other half of that sentence
and was missing. Recording what landed in the truth dir is no use to a run that
is told "damage applied" either way. Run 14 staged castor_pollux with a
requested dose of >= 4.248 mm and an applied dose of 0.100 mm -- the mutation's
own `grid_step` -- because the block was hard against the outline and
`on_overflow='clip'` ate 98% of it. Nothing in this file read `rec['clipped']`,
`rec['status']` or `rec['dose_mm_applied']`, so it exited 0. The run then spent
an hour proving, correctly, that an undamaged board was undamaged.

A draw is now accepted only if it MEASURABLY landed (see MIN_MATERIAL_MM /
MATERIAL_FRAC below), and otherwise redrawn up to MAX_DRAWS times before the
script refuses outright. The disclosure stays fence-safe: one line saying a
redraw happened, with no count, no kind, no block and no dose.
