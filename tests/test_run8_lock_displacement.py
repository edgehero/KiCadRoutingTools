"""A displaced part must never be recommended for a lock.

Found by running the combined placement+routing skill on a deliberately
scrambled board. The placement half's second stage says "separate the parts
whose position is NOT a netlist question" and runs the lock advisor. On that
board the advisor promoted to HIGH -- and printed in its paste-ready `--lock`
line -- three parts whose ONLY qualifying reason was:

    courtyard leaves the board outline by 44.44 mm
    courtyard leaves the board outline by 21.80 mm
    courtyard leaves the board outline by  8.88 mm

Those were the scrambled parts. Pasting that line freezes the damage as a
decision, and every later stage then treats the wrong pose as ground truth --
the wrong-basin failure, handed to the executor by a tool it was told to trust.

The rule itself is sound for the case it was written for: an edge connector or
a castellated module DOES leave the outline, and that overhang is a real signal
that its position is a mechanical fact. What was missing is that the same
measurement has two opposite meanings:

    straddling  -- pads on the board, shell past the edge   -> mechanical fact
    wholly off  -- touching nothing                         -> displacement

So the test is not the magnitude, it is whether any of the body is still on the
board. Magnitude alone cannot separate them: a big connector on a small board
can out-hang a small part parked just past the edge.

Note what this does NOT fix, deliberately: a part hanging PARTLY off an edge is
geometrically indistinguishable from a genuine edge-mounted part, so it stays
HIGH. Separating those needs corroboration this rule does not have.
