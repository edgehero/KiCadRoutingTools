"""The film: placement motion outside the loop, and the attempts that were dropped.

Two defects this pins, both of which made a run's own record misleading:

  * A placement step changes no copper, and the movie animates copper deltas.
    Footprint motion was animated only through a `movie_camera.Stage`, and a
    Stage was built only from `place_route_loop`'s sidecars -- so every chain
    driven by hand rendered the step that decides everything downstream as ONE
    frame. Measured before the fix: seed -> placed, 14 parts moved, 1 frame.
  * The accepted spine was 10 boards of the 45 a run left on disk. The other 35
    are where the search actually happened and nothing could show them.
