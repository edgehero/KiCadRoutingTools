"""The impossibility guard, against throats of known width.

Across four recorded runs, 9 of 14 "no placement can fix this" claims were
later refuted, and EVERY claim that a pad was unroutable in principle was
wrong. They were made from renders, from a router's failure, and from
arithmetic on the wrong two edges. The rule this instrument enforces is: no
impossibility claim without a numeric field.

So the tests are built around gaps whose answer is arithmetic. A wall with a
gap of width G, graded at clearance c, admits a track of exactly `G - 2c`; the
measurement must agree to within the raster step, and must say CAGED when the
gap is too narrow and PASSABLE when it is wide enough -- including the case
where those differ by a few microns, which is the case the whole thing exists
for.
