"""A watcher must not scan its own output.

Run 21 armed the bug watcher the way the brief says to -- output teed into the
work dir, so the watchers can see everything -- and `watch_bugs` scanned the
file it was writing. Every line it emitted matched a signature on the next
poll, so each hit quoted the previous one verbatim:

    NOT-BUILDABLE assembly0.json:1934: "verdict": "NOT BUILDABLE",
    NOT-BUILDABLE watch_bugs.log:2: NOT-BUILDABLE assembly0.json:1934: ...
    NOT-BUILDABLE watch_bugs.log:3: NOT-BUILDABLE watch_bugs.log:2: ...
    NOT-BUILDABLE watch_bugs.log:4: NOT-BUILDABLE logs/p0_assembly.log:288: ...

Eight lines in, ONE real finding had become six nested copies of itself. That
is the same class as the `.md` exclusion this module already documents --
narration is not an incident -- except self-amplifying, so it does not pad the
log, it destroys it. The run's report is REQUIRED to quote every line each
watcher emitted, so this defect attacks the deliverable directly.

Two halves are pinned here: the exclusion works, and it is narrow enough that
a tool log is still scanned. An over-broad fix would be worse than the bug --
a watcher that scans nothing reports nothing, and reports it quietly.
