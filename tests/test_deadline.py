"""The deadline contract: a stage that stops itself must SAY so, and a partial
must be exactly as fatal as no result at all.

Run 9 lost two stages to an external `timeout`: no output board, no
JSON_SUMMARY, and an exit code belonging to the shell rather than the tool. The
fix lets a stage stop on its own budget -- which introduces a NEW hazard the
tests below exist to pin: a partial summary PARSES, so a consumer that only
checked "is there a summary" would now silently accept an unfinished run's
tallies as a whole board's. That would be quieter, and worse, than the failure
it replaced.
