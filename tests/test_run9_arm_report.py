"""The recovery table is measured, and the two ways it used to lie are shut.

The previous run's table was assembled by hand and three of its numbers were
wrong, all in the flattering direction. Two of those were tool defects rather
than typing:

1. HOME WAS COUNTED IN THE WRONG SPACE. `placement_recovery_arm.py` computed
   it from footprint-ORIGIN distance with a hardcoded 2.0, against
   `recovery.py`'s own headline rule that displacement is measured in PAD
   space. A part rotated in place moves its origin 0.00 mm and its pads up to
   49 mm, so an origin-distance count reports a rotated part as home. The
   correct value was already computed and thrown away.

2. `check_assembly --json` CARRIED NO VERDICT. Every reader re-derived
   `blocking == 0 and not locked_contact_pairs` for itself, and the ones that
   got it wrong got it wrong quietly -- the arm scraped the verdict back out of
   stdout, and board_score's assembly component reads `blocking` alone.
