"""#768/#769: the cap pass priced on one branch of the `--clearance` rule and
wrote back on the other, in the same invocation.

CLAUDE.md specifies two branches and only two. GIVEN, `--clearance` is a CEILING:
every class is priced at ``min(class, it)`` and the output project is clamped
down to it. OMITTED, there is no ceiling: each pair is priced at its own class
and the project is preserved.

This step did the OMITTED branch for pricing -- `PadClearanceModel.for_board`
admits any class above the flat scalar and `pair_with_source` raises the pair to
it, i.e. ``max(base, ncl)`` -- and the GIVEN branch for the writeback, calling
`fix_project_for_output(clearance=args.clearance)`, which clamps
``rules.min_clearance``, ``rules.min_hole_clearance``, the Default class and (by
default) every non-Default class. Measured at cd623938 on two real declaring
boards, no staging::

    glasgow_revC    --clearance 0.1 -> "above the 0.1mm floor: ... requires
                    0.2mm (netclass)" x19, ships net_class[Default] = 0.1
    ottercast_audio --clearance 0.1 -> same two numbers, x79

It could not do EITHER branch, because `--clearance` was declared with
``default=defaults.CLEARANCE`` -- a non-None default, so "given" and "omitted"
were indistinguishable after parse_args(). It was the only one of the seven
clearance-taking CLIs shaped that way; route.py:5871 and all five placement
siblings use ``default=None``.

WHERE THE CAP LANDS IS THE DESIGN. Not in `pair_with_source` -- in `for_board`'s
netclass admission map, which IS this pass's netclass tier and is the same place
the router caps (route.py pre-caps the netclass map before `set_net_clearances`
installs it). Three things follow, and each has an arm below:

  * The dru REPLACE and the pad override run AFTER it, so they keep OUTRANKING
    the ceiling. They must: the writeback clamps neither, so KiCad goes on
    enforcing both. That is the maintainer's Q1 on PR #729, answered in code.
  * `ceiling=None` is the default, so `grade_pad_legality` and `quench` -- the
    other two `for_board` callers, neither of which writes a project -- are
    untouched. `test_697`'s `test_default_netclass_is_not_dropped` is the
    closest thing to a collision in the repo and stays green BECAUSE of that.
  * The cap is a ``min``, not a drop. A class UNDER the ceiling still raises the
    pair normally; only one above it collapses. A resolver that merely deleted
    the map would pass a test that only checks the collapse.

TWO THINGS THE ISSUE DID NOT RECORD, both found by measurement and both fixed:

  * THE DEFECT FIRED WITH NO FLAG AT ALL. argparse supplied 0.25 and
    `fix_project_for_output`'s `clamp_nondefault_netclasses` defaults True, so
    merely RUNNING the pass on a board with a class above 0.25 clamped it.
  * `--clearance` ALSO WROTE ``min_hole_clearance``, because `compute_targets`
    defaults the copper-to-hole target to the copper clearance. The same
    glasgow run that printed "Copper-to-hole clearance 0.25mm (from the board's
    own min_hole_clearance)" then wrote 0.25 -> 0.1 into the project. That is
    #768's defect one key over, so the writeback passes the key explicitly now.

AND THE WRITEBACK IS NOT SKIPPED WHEN THE FLAG IS OMITTED, which is what an
earlier draft of this change did. Measured: that call does TWO jobs, and with no
--clearance at all it still writes 16 values on glasgow -- the board's own size
minima, the severities, `fab_floor_origin`. Skipping it throws the #441 custody
half away. The rule is per KEY: write back the number the run actually used.

#769 rides here rather than in its own PR because it is the same rule applied
twice. The clamp used to run only when a cap actually MOVED, so a run asked for
a ceiling that legitimately moved nothing took the unchanged-copy path and
shipped the INPUT's spec for the next step to grade against.

LAYER COUNT. The cap has no layer axis -- it operates on a net-name -> clearance
map -- and `TestLayerCountIsNotAnAxis` is what says so rather than assumes it.
The one layer-dependent quantity in reach is the FAB clearance floor, which
buckets at 2 (0.10mm) vs 4 (0.09mm) with the boundary at THREE copper layers.
It is disclosed and deliberately NOT applied: `check_drc` does not fab-floor
copper clearance either (`_pair_cl` has no `fab_floor_min` in its chain), and
#756's rule for this function's two sibling resolvers is MATCH THE GRADER.
Wrapping would refuse cap landings this pass's own checker passes.

Conventions (from #725/#731/#732/#733/#737/#750/#756 and CLAUDE.md): REAL parser
dataclasses; every assertion names the single-line MUTATION that must kill it,
with the count the battery measured; assert you are ON the branch before
asserting about it; every refusal paired with an acceptance that still happens.
The battery ships as `tests/mutate_768.py`. Measured, 31 rows:

    31 KILLED, 0 SURVIVED, 0 BROKEN

RE-MEASURED AT #780, AND THE PREVIOUS NUMBER WAS ALREADY WRONG. It said
28 rows / 27 KILLED / 1 expected SURVIVOR; the branch that shipped it had
30 rows and no survivor -- the row it named
(`writeback-spends-the-flag-not-the-priced-value`) is not in ROWS and was
not in ROWS then either. #780 adds one row, takes the total to 31, and
re-derives the whole line from a run rather than editing the old one to
agree. Two rows in that run reported BROKEN before being re-anchored, both
because #780 moved text a row quoted; a BROKEN row exits the battery
non-zero, which is how they were found rather than assumed.

Seven of those rows exist because a CLI/GUI parity review found the GUI gate
reading the WRONG control (`fix_drc_settings`, a box that clamps no net class at
all) and, on the standalone call path, reading a key that config never carries.
Two string-count assertions in this file passed it. The rows that now catch it
name `tests/gui_parity/test_768_cap_ceiling_real_dialog.py`, which drives the
real headless dialog and captures the kwargs the engine is handed -- the only
thing that can decide a VALUE.

The expected survivor is `writeback-spends-the-flag-not-the-priced-value`:
`clearance=_priced` and `clearance=args.clearance` are provably equal on every
board reachable here, so nothing can prove the honest spelling is the one that
shipped. It is recorded rather than deleted, because an inert row quietly
removed is a hole and an inert row recorded is a finding.

TWO OF THESE ARMS EXIST BECAUSE THE BATTERY FOUND THEM HOLLOW, and both are
labelled where they sit: the layer-degradation arm's three degenerate lists all
had length 0 or 2, so a resolver that dropped the `.Cu` filter still bucketed
correctly and the row SURVIVED; and the cap-is-a-min arm compared the value SET
only, so a mutant that put EVERY net at the ceiling matched it. Six `# MUTATION:`
notes also carried counts written before the run, one of them naming the wrong
test entirely -- corrected here against what was measured, which is the whole
reason `test_750:151-155` records the same mistake.

    A "0 diffs on the corpus" run therefore proves NOTHING on its own, which is
    why this class asserts the REASON as well as the outcome.

    RE-RECORDED 2026-08-30 and the expiry worked exactly as designed: `d00032d8`
    (#805's obstacle ref-count release gate) added a sibling `.kicad_pro` for
    glasgow_revC for reasons of its own, which moved that board out of the
    project-less majority -- 20 of 22 became 19 of 22. Re-measured rather than
    adjusted: every one of the 19 still resolves to the packaged default, and
    glasgow_revC lands on its OWN declaration (0.2, board netclass) exactly like
    flat_hierarchy, so the finding is unchanged in substance and only its
    membership grew. Note what this costs: the fanout-clearance step is no
    longer inert on glasgow_revC, so a future corpus A/B that uses it as a
    control has to account for the clamp."""
