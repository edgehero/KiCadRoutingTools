"""Paired A/B for placement objective terms, graded by an INDEPENDENT check.

Every term in the quench objective is a claim about routability, and a term can
always be made to improve the number it is itself computed from. This runs the
same board through the optimizer twice -- flag off, flag on -- writes both, and
then grades both with `floorplan.grade(..., with_health=True)`, which
re-derives its corridors from the FINAL poses. The optimizer minimises against
rectangles frozen at construction; the grader does not use them. So a term that
only games its own model shows up here as "improved nothing".

Table-driven on purpose (`ROWS`): the next term under test adds a row, not a
file. Adding a row does not change how any existing row is judged.

The verdict is a PAIRED, DIRECTIONAL, NON-REGRESSION rule, never a per-board
absolute:

  * the claimed signal must improve on at least N-1 boards,
  * and must regress on NONE,
  * while `crossings` and `hpwl` -- the terms that already shipped -- do not
    get worse anywhere.

Unchanged boards count as neutral AND ARE PRINTED. A silently-dropped neutral
board is how a term with no effect on 3 of 4 boards reads as a clean sweep.

Usage:
    python3 -X utf8 tests/test_placement_ab.py            # the default table
    python3 -X utf8 tests/test_placement_ab.py --row corridor-ulx3s

#
# `quench_on` is merged into the OFF kwargs to make the ON run, so a row states
# exactly one difference. `corridors` are the health.bus_corridors the intent
# declares; the grader reads the same declaration and re-derives the geometry.
#
# `signal` is the JSON_SUMMARY-style key the row claims to improve, and
# `guard` the keys that must not get worse. Lower is better for all of them.
# `expect` pins the mark that was MEASURED. Omit it for a term still on trial;
# a trial row must improve on >= N-1 boards and regress on none.
#
# `rejected` marks a term that was tried, measured, and NOT adopted. Its rows
# stay in the table as the evidence and as a change detector -- they are judged
# against their recorded marks rather than against "the term must help", so a
# rejected term does not leave a permanent red mark that someone eventually
# deletes along with the finding.
#
# The corridor globs name sub-buses SEPARATELY. Merging them halves the
# corridor's `cover` (address and data leave the part on different faces, so
# the endpoint average lands between them) and the resulting rectangle is a
# fiction: ulx3s SDRAM_A* scores cover 0.81, merged SDRAM_* scores 0.46. This
# is not a footnote -- the first run of this harness used the merged glob and
# reported the term INERT, because it had been pointed at a phantom.
