""""Is this board done?" gets a command, and it fails closed.

`board_score` is the authority on `blocking` and it says "done" too easily read
alone. It exits 0 with four of nine components UNGRADED (their flags were not
passed, and `ungraded` does not touch the exit code); `undersized` runs at the
FAB floor when no spec numbers are given, so 0 there is not "the sizes are
right"; and it has no component at all for orphan stubs, weird copper or pad
overlaps.

Underneath all of it the DRC writeback only ever LOOSENS -- every constraint
set to min(current, target), target being the smallest object actually placed
-- so a board that routed below its own declared minimum rewrites that minimum
and then grades clean against the new one. Measured once at 5629 of 5933
segments below the original floor with every checker reading clean. That was
disclosed in a printed line and enforced by nothing.

What this pins:

  * UNGRADED does not make a board fail, but is always NAMED. A board with no
    spec files has nothing to grade those components against, and making it
    fatal would put every corpus board permanently in the failing state.
  * a relaxed FAB FLOOR is UNSOUND and outranks everything else, because it is
    the one failure where the clean report is itself the evidence.
  * the verdict classes have distinct exit codes.
