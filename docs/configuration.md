# Configuration Reference

This document describes all configuration options for the KiCad Grid Router.

## Command-Line Options

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Single-ended routing (all nets by default)
python py_router/route.py input.kicad_pcb [output.kicad_pcb] [OPTIONS]  # Default output: input_routed.kicad_pcb
python py_router/route.py input.kicad_pcb --overwrite [OPTIONS]         # Overwrite input file

# Differential pair routing (all nets by default)
python py_router/route_diff.py input.kicad_pcb [output.kicad_pcb] [OPTIONS]  # Default output: input_routed.kicad_pcb
python py_router/route_diff.py input.kicad_pcb --overwrite [OPTIONS]         # Overwrite input file
```

Use `route.py` for single-ended nets and `route_diff.py` for differential pairs. By default, all nets are routed. Use `--nets` to filter specific patterns.

`route.py` always writes the output file, even when nothing routes (no valid nets, or all already connected) — it writes an unchanged copy of the input in that case, so output→input pipelines don't break on a missing file.

Pads with no pad number (paste/thermal-via artifacts KiCad doesn't netlist individually) are not used as routing targets; they remain copper obstacles.

### Net Selection

Net names support glob wildcards. Use `--nets` (or `-n`) to specify patterns:

```bash
# Exact net names
python py_router/route.py in.kicad_pcb out.kicad_pcb --nets "Net-(U2A-DATA_0)" "Net-(U2A-DATA_1)"

# Wildcard patterns
python py_router/route.py in.kicad_pcb out.kicad_pcb --nets "Net-(U2A-DATA_*)"

# Multiple patterns
python py_router/route.py in.kicad_pcb out.kicad_pcb --nets "Net-(*CLK*)" "Net-(*DATA*)"

# Route all nets on a component (auto-excludes GND/VCC/VDD/unconnected)
python py_router/route.py in.kicad_pcb out.kicad_pcb --component U1

# Several components at once, with fnmatch globs. A BARE reference is exact,
# so U1 does not also select U10; write U1* if that is what you want.
python py_router/route.py in.kicad_pcb out.kicad_pcb --component U3 U4 "J1*"
```

`--component` takes one or more references and errors out (naming the offender,
with a did-you-mean) if any of them matches no footprint — routing the remaining
subset after a typo would quietly do the wrong thing. Because it accepts several
values it consumes the tokens after it, so pass the output via `--output` or put
`--component` last.

### Ripping Pre-Existing Routes

| Option | Default | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `--rip-existing-nets` | off (untouched) | Net name patterns of **pre-existing** routed nets that may be ripped up and re-routed when they block a net being routed |

By default the router **never** rips committed tracks that were already on the
input board — only nets it routed *in this run* are candidates for rip-up (see
[Rip-Up and Reroute](rip-up-reroute.md)). `--rip-existing-nets PATTERN` lifts
that restriction for the matching pre-existing routed nets, so the router may
tear them up and re-route them when they block a net it is trying to route (for
example on a board already routed by a previous run). Use `'*'` to allow any
non-plane net.

```bash
# Let the router rip and re-route any pre-existing DATA net that gets in the way
python py_router/route.py in.kicad_pcb out.kicad_pcb --nets "*CLK*" --rip-existing-nets "*DATA*"

# Allow ripping any pre-existing (non-plane) net
python py_router/route.py in.kicad_pcb out.kicad_pcb --nets "*" --rip-existing-nets "*"
```

### Forcing a Re-Route

| Option | Default | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `--force-reroute` | off | Rip and re-route **from scratch** every net selected by `--nets`, even if it is already fully connected |

`--rip-existing-nets` only rips nets that *block* another route, so an
already-connected net named in `--nets` is normally skipped ("already fully
connected") — there is no way to make the router replace a
connected-but-unwanted route (e.g. one that squeaked through a corridor you
want cleared). `--force-reroute` is that way: every selected net has its
copper stripped and is replanned from scratch. In the GUI it is the
**Force re-route selected nets** checkbox on the Route tab.

Safety rails:

- Requires an explicit net scope (`--nets`, positional patterns, or
  `--component`) — without one the run is rejected rather than silently
  ripping the whole board.
- Protected nets (length-matched groups, routed diff pairs — see
  [Length Matching](length-matching.md)) are skipped unless named **exactly**
  (a glob is not an override); KiCad-**locked** copper is never ripped.
- Plane (zone-owning) nets are skipped — use `route_planes.py` for those.
- If the re-route produces no copper at all, the net's original copper is
  restored, so a failed replan never trades a working route for nothing.
- The net re-routes at its original dominant track width unless this run
  specifies one (same width-preservation as ripped pre-existing nets).

```bash
# Replace the existing /CLK route with a fresh from-scratch plan
python py_router/route.py in.kicad_pcb out.kicad_pcb --nets "/CLK" --force-reroute
```

### Geometry Options

| Option | Default | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `--track-width` | 0.3 | Track width in mm (ignored if `--impedance` specified) |
| `--impedance` | - | Target single-ended impedance in ohms (calculates width per layer from stackup) |
| `--clearance` | board's Default net-class clearance (else 0.25) | Copper clearance of the **Default net class** for this run, in mm; nets in other classes route at their own class clearance (pairwise `max`, as KiCad's DRC does). **Omitted** → the board's own Default class from the sibling `.kicad_pro`. Since #530 this no longer caps the other classes; use `--net-clearances <json>` for explicit per-net values |
| `--clearance-ceiling` | - | Cap **every** net class (Default included) at this clearance for the run and clamp the output `.kicad_pro`'s classes down to it — the "stock net classes are aspirational" workflow that `--clearance` used to switch on implicitly (#439). **This is the flag for a chained run**: on a project an earlier step already lowered, the run stays at that lower floor instead of routing wider, which is what the recorded corpus chains and the routing skills use. GUI: the **Class ceiling** checkbox next to Min Clearance |
| `--via-size` | Default net-class via (else 0.5) | Via outer diameter in mm. **Given** → every net's vias are this size. **Omitted** → each net's vias are drawn at its **own** net class / `.kicad_dru` `via_diameter` (#530 decision 4): the router carries one via-legality map per distinct via geometry on the board (`grid_router` 0.22.0+; an older binary routes every net at the Default class size and says so) |
| `--via-drill` | Default net-class drill (else 0.3) | Via drill diameter in mm; per-net exactly like `--via-size` |
| `--grid-step` | 0.1 | Grid resolution in mm |

**Impedance-controlled routing:** When `--impedance` is specified, track widths are automatically calculated per layer using IPC-2141 formulas based on the board stackup. Outer layers use microstrip formulas (typically wider tracks) and inner layers use stripline formulas (typically narrower tracks). Via clearance calculations account for the varying track widths per layer.

### Fab Tier Options

The **fab tier** is the JLCPCB manufacturing floor every routing step shrinks tracks,
vias and clearances *down toward* when it needs to. It is shared by every CLI
(`route.py`, `route_diff.py`, `route_planes.py`, `repair_planes.py`,
`bga_fanout.py`, `qfn_fanout.py`, `check_drc.py`, `fix_kicad_drc_settings.py`,
`list_nets.py`) and the GUI (one selector on the Route tab). Values are sourced from
[jlcpcb.com/capabilities](https://jlcpcb.com/capabilities).

| Option | Default | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `--fab-tier` | `auto` | `auto` (the standard floor, escalating to advanced when a fine-pitch fan-out, plane tap or last-resort via cannot fit; warned and counted), `standard` (no extra fab cost, **hard**) or `advanced` (tighter, "more costly", **hard**) |
| `--fab-overrides` | - | Path to a file overlaying the tier's floors (only the keys it lists) |
| `--escalation` | `fab` | How far below a **requested** size a failing net may be retried: `fab` (down to the fab tier floor, below the board's own minimums; completion first, every narrowing disclosed), `board` (down to the board's own Board Setup minimums, i.e. what KiCad's DRC accepts; an unset key falls back to the fab tier floor), `off` (never; the net fails and is reported) |
| `--strict-sizes` | off | Exit 3 when any feature was delivered below its requested size or a fab-tier escalation fired |

The tier is a **floor ladder**:

- **`standard`** — the cheap floor (per layer count: 2-layer track/clearance 0.127/0.127,
  4+ layer 0.0889/0.10; via 0.45 / drill 0.20; via hole-to-hole 0.20). A **hard**
  floor since #857: nothing on the board goes below it.
- **`advanced`** — the JLC "more costly" floor (track/clearance 0.10/0.10 on 2-layer,
  0.0762/0.09 on 4+; via 0.25 / drill 0.15). A **hard** floor.
- **`auto`** — the default: `standard` first, **escalating to `advanced`** (one
  warning line per context, and a count in the run summary) when a fine-pitch fan-out,
  a plane tap or a last-resort via genuinely cannot fit at the standard floor. This
  is what maximises completion; what #857 changed is the disclosure — the escalation
  used to change what the board costs without saying so anywhere a harness could see
  it (149 silent escalations on one board), and now every one is counted and named.
  Pass `standard` or `advanced` for a hard floor that never escalates.

**Escalation policy** (`--escalation`, the same choice on the GUI's Route tab) is
orthogonal to the tier and bounds every place the engine narrows a track, shrinks a
via or tightens a clearance to complete a net: the per-net rescue, the terminal
escalation, the terminal graze neck, fine-pitch plane taps, via-in-pad clamps and
last-resort vias. Under the default `fab`, a descent may go down to the fab tier
floor, below the board's own declared minimums (the writeback then lowers the
project's `rules.min_*` to match, as before); this is the completion-first setting.
Under `board`, a descent stops at the board's own `rules.min_*` (Board Setup >
Constraints), so the output is DRC-clean against the input project by construction;
a minimum the board leaves unset (KiCad writes 0) falls back to the fab tier floor
for that key. A board minimum bounds descents only
when the run's own request respects it: a request already below the declared
minimum (the stock 0.5 mm via on a project nobody edited, routed with
`--via-size 0.3`) marks that minimum as stale for the run, is said so on the
console, and descents for that key bound at the fab floor instead. An explicit
request is never pinned up to a board minimum, only to the fab floor. Under
`off` nothing is narrowed and a net that cannot complete at the requested
geometry fails and is reported.

**Disclosure.** Every descent is recorded and reported three ways: the
`JSON_SUMMARY` block `design_rules` (policy, tier, the board floors read, every
narrowing with net / kind / requested / delivered / site, the fab-tier escalation
count, and the `.kicad_dru` rules the tool could not honour), an `escalations`
count in `JSON_SUMMARY_MIN`, and one end-of-run line (`Design rules [--escalation
fab, --fab-tier auto]: 7 feature(s) on 3 net(s) delivered below the requested
size (...)`). `--strict-sizes` makes that line a non-zero exit.

| Floor (per layer count) | standard | advanced |
|---|---|---|
| via diameter / drill | 0.45 / 0.20 | 0.25 / 0.15 |
| track / clearance (2-layer) | 0.127 / 0.127 | 0.10 / 0.10 |
| track / clearance (4+ layer) | 0.0889 / 0.10 | 0.0762 / 0.09 |
| via hole-to-hole / pad hole-to-hole | 0.20 / 0.45 | 0.20 / 0.45 |

**Override file** (`--fab-overrides`) — a plain, human-editable file overlaying the
selected tier. Only the floor values it lists change; the rest come from the base tier.
Supplying one **disables escalation** (the floor becomes exactly *base tier + file*),
since the file states your exact fab limits. One `key = value` (or `key: value`, or
`key value`) per line; `#` starts a comment; keys are `track_width`, `clearance`,
`via_diameter`, `via_drill`, `hole_to_hole`, `pad_hole_to_hole`, `annular`:

```
# my_fab.txt — JLC + a tighter drill I've confirmed
via_drill = 0.15
clearance = 0.09
```

A ready-to-copy, fully-commented template listing every key and the built-in tier
values lives at **[`fab_overrides.example.txt`](../fab_overrides.example.txt)** in the
repo root. (`track_width` / `clearance` are layer-dependent in the tier tables, but an
override sets one fixed value for every board — override them only if you want that.)

```bash
# Route to the cheap floor (default, hard); descents stop at the board's own minimums
python py_router/route.py in.kicad_pcb out.kicad_pcb --nets "Net*"

# Let dense fan-outs escalate to the advanced via (warned + counted)
python py_router/route.py in.kicad_pcb out.kicad_pcb --nets "Net*" --fab-tier auto

# Opt the whole board into the tighter, more-costly floor
python py_router/route.py in.kicad_pcb out.kicad_pcb --nets "Net*" --fab-tier advanced

# Never narrow anything; fail the net instead, and make that a non-zero exit
python py_router/route.py in.kicad_pcb out.kicad_pcb --nets "Net*" --escalation off --strict-sizes

# Declare your own fab capability
python py_router/route.py in.kicad_pcb out.kicad_pcb --nets "Net*" --fab-overrides my_fab.txt
```

**Floor enforcement.** An explicit `--track-width`, `--clearance`, `--via-size`,
`--via-drill` or `--hole-to-hole-clearance` is checked against the **physical** fab
floor (the `--fab-overrides` file when given, else the advanced rung: 0.25/0.15 via,
0.09–0.10 mm track/clearance) and **pinned** up to it with a warning when set below.
The selected tier and the board's own minimums bound what the router may descend to
on its own, never an explicit request: `--via-size 0.3` under the hard `standard` tier
is routed at 0.3 as asked (no automatic descent below it), exactly as a request below a
stock Board Setup minimum is. The GUI pins the corresponding Basic-tab spin control the
same way. Grade verification (`check_drc.py`) grades sizes at the board's own minimums
and rules (what KiCad grades) raised to the same physical floor.

### Post-Route DRC Settings

As their final step, all four routing CLIs (`route.py`, `route_diff.py`,
`route_planes.py`, `repair_planes.py`) rewrite the output's sibling
`.kicad_pro` so KiCad's Board Setup floors match the clearances/sizes just routed
— a manual DRC in KiCad then flags only genuine problems instead of stock-default
noise (issue #160). The [DRC Settings Fixer](utilities.md#drc-settings-fixer-fix_kicad_drc_settingspy)
does the work; these flags tune it. The GUI plugin applies the equivalent on the
live board via the pcbnew API.

| Option | Default | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `--no-fix-drc-settings` | off (fix is on) | Do **not** adjust the output's `.kicad_pro` DRC constraints afterwards; leave KiCad's stock floors |
| `--relax-drc-severities` | off | ALSO lower the project's DRC severities for the non-routing categories (courtyard shapes, solder-mask bridges, footprint/library issues incl. `annular_width` → ignore; `starved_thermal`, `courtyards_overlap` → warning). Off by default (#856): a routing step never changes what the project counts as a violation unless asked; the previous values are kept under `kicad_routing_tools.saved_severities` |
| `--keep-thermal` | off | Deprecated no-op (with `--relax-drc-severities`, leaves `starved_thermal` untouched) |
| `--enable-used-layers` | off | Add any layer the board uses but is missing from its `(layers)` table back into the `.kicad_pcb`, so KiCad stops flagging `item_on_disabled_layer`. Off by default because it edits the board, not just DRC settings |

### Power Net Options

| Option | Default | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `--power-nets` | - | Glob patterns for power nets (e.g., `"*GND*" "*VCC*"`) |
| `--power-nets-widths` | - | Track widths in mm for each power-net pattern (must match `--power-nets` length) |
| `--neckdown-length` | 2.5 | Narrow track length in mm from the pads when a failed wide power route is retried at the default width (neck-down) |
| `--neckdown-taper-length` | 0.5 | Narrow-to-wide width taper length in mm (0 = abrupt) |
| `--no-power-tap-neckdown` | off | Disable the neck-down retry of failed wide power routes |

```bash
# Route with wider tracks for power nets
python py_router/route.py input.kicad_pcb output.kicad_pcb --nets "Net*" \
  --power-nets "*GND*" "*VCC*" "+3.3V" \
  --power-nets-widths 0.4 0.5 0.3
  # default track-width is 0.3 for non-power nets
```

Patterns are matched in order - first match determines width. Obstacle clearances automatically adjust for wider power traces.

See [Power Net Analysis](power-nets.md) for automatic detection, AI-powered analysis, and IPC-2221 track width guidelines.

### Algorithm Options

| Option | Default | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `--via-cost` | 50 | Via penalty in 0.1mm grid steps, i.e. 50 = 5mm of path; mm-equivalent at any `--grid-step` (effectively doubled for diff pairs since two vias are placed) |
| `--max-iterations` | 200000 | A* iteration limit per route |
| `--max-probe-iterations` | 5000 | Quick probe per direction to detect stuck routes |
| `--heuristic-weight` | 1.9 | A* greediness (>1 = faster, <1 = more optimal) |
| `--turn-cost` | 1000 | Penalty for direction changes (encourages straighter paths) |
| `--max-ripup` | 3 | Max blockers to rip up at once during rip-up and retry |
| `--ripup-abandon-metric` | `stranded` | Keep-retry vs abandon rule for multipoint tap rip-ups (see [rip-up-reroute.md](rip-up-reroute.md#abandon-metrics)) |
| `--routing-clearance-margin` | 1.0 | Multiplier on track-via clearance (1.0 = minimum DRC) |
| `--hole-to-hole-clearance` | board's `min_hole_to_hole` (else 0.20) | Minimum drill hole edge-to-edge clearance (mm). Omitted → the board's own constraint minimum (#439) |
| `--board-edge-clearance` | board's `min_copper_edge_clearance` (else 0.0) | Clearance from board edge in mm. Omitted → the board's own constraint minimum (#439) |
| `--proximity-heuristic-factor` | 0.02 | Factor for proximity-aware A* heuristic (higher = faster but may find suboptimal paths, 0 = disabled) |
| `--ripped-route-avoidance-radius` | 1.0 | Radius around ripped route corridors to apply soft penalty (mm) |
| `--ripped-route-avoidance-cost` | 0.1 | Cost penalty for routing through ripped corridors (0 = disabled) |

See [Rip-Up and Reroute](rip-up-reroute.md) for how failed routes trigger rip-up, how blockers are identified and ranked, and how ripped nets are rerouted.

### Routing Strategy Options

| Option | Default | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `--ordering` / `-o` | mps | Net ordering: `mps`, `inside_out`, or `original` |
| `--direction` / `-d` | forward | Direction: `forward` or `backward` |
| `--layers` / `-l` | all copper layers | Routing layers. For `route.py` the default is all of the board's copper layers; `route_diff.py` and `bga_fanout.py` default to `F.Cu B.Cu` |
| `--layer-costs` | (see below) | Per-layer cost multipliers (1.0-1000). Default: all 1.0 for 4+ layers; F.Cu=1.0, B.Cu=3.0 for 2 layers |
| `--no-bga-zones [REFS...]` | (auto-detect) | Disable BGA exclusion zones. No args = all. With refs (U1 U3) = only those |

### Proximity Penalty Options

| Option | Default | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `--stub-proximity-radius` | 2.0 | Radius around stubs to penalize (mm) |
| `--stub-proximity-cost` | 0.2 | Cost penalty at stub center (mm equivalent) |
| `--via-proximity-cost` | 10.0 | Via cost multiplier in stub proximity zones (0 = no extra cost) |
| `--bga-proximity-radius` | 7.0 | Radius around BGA edges to penalize (mm) |
| `--bga-proximity-cost` | 0.2 | Cost penalty at BGA edge (mm equivalent) |
| `--track-proximity-distance` | 2.0 | Radius around routed tracks to penalize on same layer (mm) |
| `--track-proximity-cost` | 0.0 | Cost penalty near routed tracks (0 = disabled) |
| `--vertical-attraction-radius` | 1.0 | Radius for cross-layer track attraction (mm) |
| `--vertical-attraction-cost` | 0.0 | Cost bonus for aligning with tracks on other layers (0 = disabled) |

### Bus Routing Options

Detects groups of nets with clustered endpoints (buses) and routes them as parallel tracks, each net attracted to its already-routed neighbor. See [Bus Routing](bus-routing.md) for the detection algorithm, middle-out routing order, and tuning guidance.

| Option | Default | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `--bus` | off | Enable bus detection and routing |
| `--bus-detection-radius` | 5.0 | Max endpoint distance for nets to form a bus (mm) |
| `--bus-min-nets` | 2 | Minimum number of nets to form a bus group |
| `--bus-attraction-radius` | 5.0 | Attraction radius around the neighbor's track (mm) |
| `--bus-attraction-bonus` | 5000 | Cost bonus for moving parallel to the neighbor's track |

### Guide Corridor Options (preferred route)

Draw a polyline on a User layer in KiCad, then enable `--guide-corridor` to route the
selected nets so they **follow** that line. The router takes the polyline's vertices as
waypoints (`--guide-corridor-spacing > 0` subdivides long segments for tighter curves) and
routes source → waypoints → target. It keeps the route on a single layer where it can — a
waypoint it can't reach cleanly on the current layer is skipped rather than forcing a layer
change, so a corridor doesn't add vias the direct route wouldn't need. It applies to all nets
routed in the run and works in either draw direction; multiple nets following the same
corridor pack alongside each other without overlapping. Supported by `route.py` and the
plugin ("Follow User-layer guide path" checkbox); not currently supported by `route_diff.py`
or `route_planes.py`.

| Option | Default | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `--guide-corridor` | off | Route selected nets to follow a user-drawn guide polyline |
| `--guide-corridor-layer` | User.1 | User layer the guide polyline is drawn on |
| `--guide-corridor-spacing` | 0.0 | Max mm between waypoints. `0` uses only the drawn segment endpoints (vertices); `>0` subdivides long segments to follow curves more tightly |

```bash
# Route two nets so they follow a corridor drawn on User.1
python py_router/route.py in.kicad_pcb out.kicad_pcb --nets "Net-(A)" "Net-(B)" --guide-corridor
```

Notes:
- **Endpoints/topology are untouched.** The waypoints only steer the path *between* the
  pads the router already chose to connect. For a multi-point net the existing MST is kept,
  and each waypoint steers the MST segment it is nearest to (so the net follows the whole
  drawn line across its topology); a waypoint used by one segment is not reused by others.
- **A corridor never makes a route fail.** It is strictly best-effort: a waypoint that
  can't be reached (or that would strand the route) is dropped, and if no waypoints can be
  followed the segment routes directly — identical to routing with no corridor. With the
  flag off, routing is byte-for-byte unchanged.
- Routes are placed one at a time; each becomes an obstacle for the next, which keeps
  multiple corridor nets from overlapping. Draw the corridor wide enough (or use separate
  lines) if you want several nets to follow it comfortably.
- The guide applies to every net routed in the run, so select only the nets you want it to
  steer. Nets routed as a detected bus (`--bus`) follow their neighbor instead of the guide.
- The route is built by routing A* legs between the waypoints and concatenating them. A
  multi-point tap or a detour can cross an earlier leg of the **same** net. KiCad allows
  same-net copper to overlap, so the net stays connected and DRC-clean against other nets,
  but the trace may be less tidy than a hand-route.
- Tested by `tests/test_guide_corridor.py` — follow, blocked-waypoint snap, shared-corridor
  non-overlap, flag-off regression, never-blocks-routing, spacing subdivision, and a real
  bundled board (`kicad_files/lvds_converter_dualclk.kicad_pcb`) with a `User.1` guide.

### Keepout Zone Options

Draw one or more closed polygons (`gr_poly`) or rectangles (`gr_rect`) on a User layer in KiCad,
then enable `--keepout` to keep routed tracks **out** of those areas. This is a **hard** keepout:
routes (and vias) cannot enter any of the polygons on any copper layer. It applies to every net
routed in the run.

| Option | Default | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `--keepout` | off | Keep routed tracks out of polygons drawn on a User layer |
| `--keepout-layer` | User.2 | User layer the keepout polygons are drawn on |

```bash
# Route a net so it avoids keepout polygons drawn on User.2
python py_router/route.py in.kicad_pcb out.kicad_pcb --nets "Net-(A)" --keepout
```

Notes:
- All closed polygons (`gr_poly`) and rectangles (`gr_rect`) found on the keepout layer are
  blocked — draw as many as you need. Use the polygon or rectangle tool, not the line tool: open
  lines (`gr_line`) don't bound an area and are ignored.
- The default keepout layer is `User.2`, distinct from the guide-corridor layer (`User.1`), so
  you can use both features at once.
- **Coverage:** keepouts are respected across single-ended, multipoint, and **differential-pair**
  routing (`route_diff.py --keepout`), and across plane via-stitching and plane repair. KiCad
  native keep-out rule areas (`(zone … (keepout …))`) are honoured automatically everywhere too,
  with no flag. (Guide corridors, by contrast, steer single-ended/multipoint routing only.)
- It's a non-copper User layer, so the polygon never affects manufacturing — it only steers the
  router.
- **Don't draw a zone over a pad you need to route.** Cells inside the polygon are blocked
  unconditionally, so a zone covering a routed net's pad can make that net unroutable. Zones are
  meant for open board area.
- Unlike a guide corridor (which is best-effort), a keepout is absolute — if a zone walls off the
  only path to a pad, that net will fail to route. With the flag off, routing is unchanged.
- **Plugin only:** the Route tab has optional "Clear guide layer after routing" / "Clear keepout
  layer after routing" checkboxes (unchecked by default). When ticked, a *successful* route deletes
  the drawn guide/keepout graphics from that User layer so you can draw fresh ones — it only acts
  for the feature it pairs with, and never runs if nothing routed.
- Tested by `tests/test_keepout.py` — flag-off regression, single-net detour, multi-net avoidance,
  and a real bundled board (`kicad_files/lvds_converter_dualclk.kicad_pcb`).

### Differential Pair Options (route_diff.py only)

These options are only available in `route_diff.py`. All nets passed to route_diff.py are treated as differential pairs.

| Option | Default | Description |

### Layer Optimization Options

These options control stub layer switching, which moves stubs to different layers before routing to avoid vias. Works for differential pairs, single-ended nets, and multi-point nets (3+ endpoints).

| Option | Default | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `--no-stub-layer-swap` | false | Disable stub layer switching (enabled by default) |
| `--can-swap-to-top-layer` | false | Allow swapping stubs to F.Cu (off by default for diff pairs due to clearance) |

**How it works:**
- When source and target stubs are on different layers, a via is normally required
- Stub layer switching moves one stub to match the other's layer, eliminating the via
- For **swap pairs**, two nets exchange layers to help each other (e.g., Net1 src:A→B and Net2 src:B→A)
- For **solo switches**, a single stub moves when it doesn't conflict with other stubs
- For **bare-pad target swaps**, a diff-pair target that is a bare outer-layer pad
  (F.Cu/B.Cu) with no stub - e.g. a connector pin boxed in by neighbouring pads
  such as the front row of a 2-row header - is fanned out onto the pair's source
  layer: a through-via is dropped on each pad and a short stub grown on the source
  layer, so an inner-layer pair can land on the pad via the via instead of fighting
  through the congested surface channel
- Multiple swap options are tried: src/src, tgt/tgt, src/tgt, tgt/src
- For **multi-point nets** (3+ endpoints, #265), all movable stubs are collapsed onto one
  common layer when every endpoint allows it (through-hole and via-in-pad pads reach any
  layer; bare SMD pads fix their copper layers; already-connected pad-to-pad copper never
  moves), picking the destination layer that needs the fewest new pad vias. Nets with no
  feasible common layer are left unchanged
- The **pad via sizes itself to fit**: a switch leaving the pad's layer drops a
  through-via at the pad, at the run's nominal via size when it clears the
  surrounding copper, else the first smaller via from the fab-tier ladder that
  does (with the standard fab-escalation warning). A nominal 0.5mm via never
  fits a 0.65mm-pitch ball field boxed by neighboring fanout vias; the 0.3/0.25
  rungs do — so a stub walled in on its own layer can still switch to an open
  layer and escape. Applies everywhere the switch machinery is used: the
  routing-failure rescue rungs (single-ended and diff-pair fallback swaps), and
  the diff-pair multipoint chain, which moves blocked terminals' stubs to the
  most-open layer as its last resort before deferring the pair to single-ended
  (moving a stub also removes the copper that walls its coupled twin)

### Length Matching Options

Length matching adds trombone-style meanders to match route lengths within groups. Useful for DDR4 DQ/DQS signals.

| Option | Default | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `--length-match-group` | - | Group of nets to length match. Use `auto` for DDR4 auto-grouping, or specify patterns |
| `--length-match-tolerance` | 0.1 | Acceptable length variance within group (mm) |
| `--meander-amplitude` | 1.0 | Height of meanders perpendicular to trace (mm) |
| `--diff-chamfer-extra` | 1.5 | Chamfer multiplier for diff pair meanders (>1 avoids P/N crossings) |
| `--diff-pair-intra-match` | false | Match P/N lengths within each diff pair (meander shorter track) |

**Auto-grouping for DDR4:**
```bash
--length-match-group auto
```
Groups nets by byte lane: DQ0-7 + DQS0, DQ8-15 + DQS1, etc.

**Manual grouping:**
```bash
--length-match-group "Net-(*DQ[0-7]*)" "Net-(*DQS0*)"
--length-match-group "Net-(*DQ[8-9]*)" "Net-(*DQ1[0-5]*)" "Net-(*DQS1*)"
```

**How it works:**
- Routes all nets first, then adds meanders to shorter routes
- Calculates pad-to-pad length including existing stub segments and via barrel lengths (parsed from board stackup)
- Stub via barrel lengths use actual stub-layer-to-pad-layer distance (not full via span for through-hole BGA pad vias)
- Via barrel length matches KiCad's length calculation for accurate matching
- Finds longest straight segment for meander insertion
- Iteratively adds meander bumps until length exceeds target, then scales down amplitude to hit exact target
- Per-bump clearance checking reduces amplitude to avoid conflicts with other traces
- Uses 45° chamfered corners for smooth trombone patterns
- Supports multi-layer routes: meanders are applied to same-layer sections, preserving via positions

See [Length Matching](length-matching.md) for the full algorithm: meander geometry, per-bump clearance checking, via barrel lengths, and DDR4 auto-grouping details.

### Time Matching Options

Time matching is an alternative to length matching that matches propagation delay instead of physical length. This accounts for different signal speeds on different layers:
- **Outer layers (microstrip)**: Faster propagation, effective dielectric = (Er + 1) / 2
- **Inner layers (stripline)**: Slower propagation, effective dielectric = Er

| Option | Default | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `--time-matching` | false | Match propagation time instead of length |
| `--time-match-tolerance` | 1.0 | Acceptable time variance within group (ps) |

**When to use time matching:**
- When routes in a group use different layers with different dielectric properties
- For high-speed signals where propagation delay matters more than physical length
- Typical FR4: outer layers ~5.4 ps/mm, inner layers ~6.9 ps/mm (~28% difference)

**Example:**
```bash
python py_router/route.py input.kicad_pcb output.kicad_pcb --nets "*DQ*" \
    --length-match-group auto \
    --time-matching \
    --time-match-tolerance 1.0
```

See [Length Matching](length-matching.md#time-matching) for how propagation delay is computed from the stackup, including via barrel delays.

### Debug Options

| Option | Default | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `--debug-lines` | false | Output debug geometry on User.3 (connectors), User.4 (stub dirs), User.8 (simplified), User.9 (raw A*) |
| `--verbose` / `-v` | false | Print detailed diagnostic output (setback checks, bus routing order, etc.) |
| `--skip-routing` | false | Skip actual routing, only do swaps and write debug info |
| `--debug-memory` | false | Print memory usage statistics at key points during routing |
| `--stats` | false | Print A* search statistics (cells expanded, heuristic efficiency) |
| `--add-teardrops` | false | Add teardrop settings to all pads **and vias** in the output file. Available on every step that writes pad/via copper: `route.py`, `route_diff.py`, `route_planes.py`, `repair_planes.py`, `bga_fanout.py`, `qfn_fanout.py` (#489 §9). In the GUI it is the one shared "Add teardrops" checkbox, which now reaches the fanout and planes tabs too. |

## Parameter Guidelines

### Via Cost

The `via_cost` parameter controls how much the router penalizes layer changes:

| Value | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| 0-25 | Many vias, shorter paths |
| 50 (default) | Balanced, discourages unnecessary vias |
| 75-100 | Few vias, longer paths |

For BGA escape routing, lower values (10-25) work well since vias are necessary.

All cost knobs (via cost, proximity costs, attraction bonuses) are calibrated at a 0.1mm
reference grid and scale internally so the cost per mm of path is the same at any
`--grid-step` - changing the grid resolution does not change what the router optimizes for.

### Heuristic Weight

Controls A* behavior:

| Value | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| 1.0 | Optimal paths (slower) |
| 1.9 (default) | Good balance of speed and quality |
| 2.5+ | Faster but may miss tight routes |

### Grid Step

Smaller grid steps allow finer routing but increase computation:

| Value | Use Case |
|-------|----------|
| 0.05 | Fine-pitch BGAs, tight clearances |
| 0.1 (default) | General purpose |
| 0.2 | Fast routing, less detail |

### Layer Costs

The `--layer-costs` parameter controls per-layer routing preferences. Higher costs make the router avoid that layer:

| Value | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| 1.0 | No penalty, layer used freely |
| 3.0 | Moderately avoided (3x cost per grid step) |
| 10.0+ | Strongly avoided, used only when necessary |

**Defaults:**
- 4+ layers: all 1.0 (inner layers available for balanced routing)
- 2 layers: F.Cu=1.0, B.Cu=3.0 (prefer top layer for cleaner assembly)

**Example:** To keep signals on F.Cu and only use B.Cu when necessary:
```bash
--layers F.Cu B.Cu --layer-costs 1.0 5.0
```

### Stub Proximity

Penalizes routes that pass near unrouted stubs:

```
Cost = stub_proximity_cost * (1 - distance/stub_proximity_radius)
```

This encourages routes to avoid blocking future routing paths.
