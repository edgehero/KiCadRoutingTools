# Placement Optimization for Routability

Research notes and design proposal for improving component placement with the
goal of improving autorouter success. Written June 2026, based on a survey of
~40 years of placement literature plus the current commercial and academic
landscape. All sources are linked in the [references](#references-and-further-reading).

**Short version:** from-scratch autoplacement has failed for a well-understood
reason that has nothing to do with optimization power, while perturbative
refinement of a human (or AI) seed placement is precisely the formulation that
works — and most of the machinery it needs already exists in this project
(the `placement/` package — quench.py / groups.py / legality.py — `rust_placer`, and the router itself).

## Why from-scratch autoplacement fails

The killer isn't the algorithm — it's **constraint capture**. The constraints
that govern placement live in mechanical CAD, datasheets, and the engineer's
head, not in the board file:

- enclosure fit, button/connector positions, mounting holes (MCAD)
- thermal spreading and rework access
- EMI zoning: noisy switchers vs sensitive analog
- datasheet intent: switching-regulator hot-loop area must be minimized as the
  *primary* objective for those 4–5 parts (TI SNVA021, ADI AN-1119 both say
  "copy the manufacturer's layout") — a wirelength-minimizing placer has no
  concept of "minimize this loop's enclosed area"
- assembly direction, pick-and-place orientation conventions, test-point access
- plain designer intent (even schematic ordering of parallel parts silently
  communicates intended board order)

Altium's own product manager conceded that routing constraints are easy to
model but placement constraints "can be driven by mechanical considerations…
ergonomic issues… heat dissipation" and that modeling them "introduces
significant overheads" — and Altium
[deleted their autoplacer at v18](https://www.altium.com/documentation/altium-designer/autoplacer-cmd-runautoplacerrunautoplacer-ad?version=17.1)
(2017) after decades of "produces garbage" feedback. The constraint-entry
death spiral: by the time you've configured the rooms/keepouts/rules the tool
needs to do well, you've already placed the board by hand.

The structural differences from ASIC placement (which *is* solved) compound
this:

- **~50–1,000 wildly heterogeneous parts** (0402 next to a BGA) vs millions of
  uniform standard cells in rows; the smoothed density fields that modern
  analytical placers depend on are only meaningful at large N
- **arbitrary rotations and two board sides** — standard-cell placers optimize
  (x, y) only; orientation is a second-class patch even in research placers
- **2–8 routing layers vs 10+ metal layers**, so placement mistakes can't be
  routed around — which specific pin pairs cross matters more than aggregate
  congestion
- **no amortization**: each board's constraint set is unique, unlike a cell
  library reused across millions of instances

The flagship academic result, **Cypress** (Cornell/NVIDIA, ISPD 2025 best
paper), states this directly: stock VLSI analytical placers like RePlAce
"fail to find a routable placement for multilayer PCB designs with components
of diverse sizes."

## What the classical toolbox offers

Four families dominate the literature; their PCB fit differs sharply:

| Family | Canonical work | PCB fit |
|---|---|---|
| Simulated annealing | TimberWolf (1985), VPR (1997), SA-PCB (2019) | **Excellent.** Derivative-free, so rotations, side flips, polygon overlap, and arbitrary constraints are just move-legality checks. Abandoned in VLSI for *scalability*, never quality — irrelevant at N ≈ 100. |
| Force-directed | Quinn & Breuer 1979 (written *for* PCBs), Kraftwerk | Good for fast initial seeds; collapses clusters into overlap without density machinery that assumes large N. |
| Min-cut partitioning | Fiduccia–Mattheyses 1982, Capo | Useful as a clustering prior (functional blocks → regions; top/bottom side assignment = one cut); not a placer for continuous coordinates. |
| Analytical/gradient | GORDIAN → ePlace → DREAMPlace → Cypress | Documented to fail on PCBs without Cypress-level surgery (per-side density maps, orientation-aware wirelength, GPU, Bayesian hyperparameter search). Wrong tool at this scale. |

TimberWolf's move set — single-part **displace** within a window that shrinks
with temperature, **pairwise exchange**, **orientation change** — is still the
canon 40 years later, and is exactly the "nudge, rotate, swap" set proposed
below. VPR's adaptive schedule is the standard tuning recipe: initial
temperature from the cost standard deviation over random moves, cooling rate
chosen to hold move-acceptance near **0.44** (Lam's result), moves per
temperature ∝ N^(4/3), exit when T < 0.005·cost/N_nets. VPR also ships the
exact UX precedent: load an existing placement file and run
`--place_quench_only` — a zero-temperature quench for when "the initial
placement is already good."

## Why perturbative refinement is the validated niche

This is the strongest finding across all research threads:

- **Detailed placement is an entire ASIC sub-discipline doing exactly this.**
  After global placement and legalization, placers run local-move refinement
  on a legal placement. The canonical move set (FastDP, ICCAD 2005):
  - *global swap*: compute a cell's **optimal region** — the median of its
    nets' bounding boxes (Goto 1981), an O(pins) computation that answers
    "where would this part ideally sit?" — then swap it with a cell or gap
    near that region if Δcost < 0
  - *local reordering*: exhaustively permute k ≈ 3 consecutive cells in a
    sliding window
  - *single-row clustering / Abacus-style DP*: with ordering fixed, slide
    cells within a row to optimal offsets by dynamic programming — directly
    applicable to a line of passives along an IC edge
  - *mirroring/flipping*: orientation-only pass; in macro placement, flipping
    alone is worth an average **7.9% HPWL** (DAS-MP 2025)

  Typical total recovery from local refinement: **5–10% wirelength**, with
  each move family worth roughly 1–8%.
- **Refine-from-seed empirically beats from-scratch** at PCB-like scale
  (tens–hundreds of rotatable blocks):
  - MaskRegulate (NeurIPS 2024) recast RL placement as *refining* a finished
    placement one macro per step, with reward = 0.7·wirelength +
    0.3·regularity; vs from-scratch MaskPlace it gained 17.1% routed
    wirelength and **73%/39% horizontal/vertical congestion-overflow
    reduction**.
  - WireMask-BBO (NeurIPS 2023) fine-tunes any existing placement by
    black-box optimization — up to 50% HPWL improvement from a seed.
  - The Kahng/Cheng re-evaluations of Google's Nature 2021 RL chip placement
    found that properly tuned parallel SA with moves {move, swap, shift,
    mirror, shuffle} **beat the RL placer at lower runtime**, and that the RL
    results depended heavily on the quality of the (commercial) *seed*
    placement — backhanded but strong evidence for "good seed + local
    optimization."
- **A human seed sidesteps constraint capture entirely.** Bound each part's
  displacement to a small radius of its original position and keep clusters
  intact, and the optimizer inherits every unmodeled constraint for free —
  the human already satisfied them. This is structurally why the *accepted*
  placement automations (Cadence Place Replicate, decap fanout under BGAs)
  all operate inside human-specified intent. Cypress itself scopes to
  "noncritical components" with critical parts fixed (and supports partial
  locks: position fixed, rotation free).
- **Reviewability fits the trust culture.** Practitioners accept co-creation
  tools and reject full automation ("never trust the autorouter"). Output
  that is visibly "your placement, nudged" can be reviewed in minutes.

## What to optimize

The existing scorer in the `placement/` package / `rust_placer` — **airwire
length + crossing penalty** — is already the right objective family.

**Crossings are the key PCB-specific signal.** Cypress's central technical
argument: with only 2–6 layers and free-angle routing, *which specific pin
pairs cross* matters more than aggregate bin congestion. They show two
placements with identical RUDY congestion scores where one has a routing
conflict and one doesn't. Their cost: decompose each net into source–sink pin
pairs (star model); for each same-layer segment pair compute the intersection
parameters (t, u) in closed form; smooth the binary "crosses" indicator with a
bell function so it's differentiable: `NC = Σ B(t−0.5)·B(u−0.5)`. Our discrete
crossing counter is the non-differentiable version of the same quantity —
fine, since SA doesn't need gradients. The theory behind crossing counts is
topological routing (SURF, DAC 1991): zero airwire crossings on a layer means
a planar ratsnest, i.e. routable on that layer in the topological sense; every
crossing costs a via pair or a detour. Because a crossing is a conflict
*between two nets*, the natural way to prioritize one net is to price each
crossing by the larger of the two nets' weights: the cost of a conflict then
tracks the most important net it obstructs.

For reference, RUDY (the standard VLSI congestion proxy) smears each net's
expected wire area uniformly over its bounding box —
`d_n = (HPWL_n · pitch) / (w_n · h_n)` accumulated onto a grid. It's O(1) to
update incrementally and worth keeping as a *tiebreaker*, but not as the
primary objective, for the reason above.

Two additions the literature argues for:

1. **A spreading/whitespace term.** An open-source SA placer benchmarked
   against Quilter found the gap wasn't wirelength — Quilter won
   route-completion (99.4% vs 87–90%) by *spreading parts apart for fanout
   room*. Pure wirelength minimization packs too tight and strangles the
   router. The author's conclusion: "a good placement is one the router can
   finish, which is not something you can compute directly from the
   placement." A pad-density map or per-component halo (AutoDMP's macro-halo
   trick) fixes this. Pin density also captures the real bottleneck at
   BGA/connector escapes.
2. **Trial-routing as the arbiter.** The fidelity hierarchy used by everything
   serious — TimberWolf stage 3 (1985) accepted placement moves only if they
   reduced global-route track counts; Cypress *evaluates* with FreeRouting
   (routability = routed pin pairs / total pin pairs); Quilter scores complete
   candidates by route completion + DRC. The pattern: cheap proxies per-move
   (microseconds), real routing per-candidate (seconds–minutes) to rank
   finalists. This project's structural advantage: the literature validates
   with FreeRouting; we have a faster router in-house, so "fraction of pin
   pairs routed" becomes a measurable, optimizable number.

### Corridor cut length: a good measurement and a bad objective

*(A negative result, kept because the reasoning that produced it was
plausible and wrong, and the next person will have the same idea.)*

When the intent declares `health.bus_corridors`, we can measure the **length**
each foreign airwire cuts through a bus's lane instead of counting that it
does. The argument for putting that in the objective went: `foreign_crossings`
is a count, a count is piecewise constant in pose, its gradient is zero almost
everywhere, so a greedy descent sees a cliff instead of a slope; the chord
length is piecewise linear, so every millimetre of a move gets priced.

The first half is right. The second half is right about the *shape* of the
function and wrong about what it buys. Three measurements, in the order they
were made, because the order is the lesson:

**1. The chord of a fully-traversing wire is position-invariant.** It is
`w/sin θ` wherever along the lane the wire crosses. A nudge slides the crossing
point and changes the toll not at all; the term responds only to *angle*, and a
3 mm move barely turns a 40 mm airwire. Pinned in
`tests/test_corridor_diagnostics.py`.

**2. The parts that block a corridor are not the parts whose airwires cut it.**
Ten parts intrude into ulx3s's SDRAM corridor; with the term at weight 20, zero
of them move differently. They are decaps, and their nets are power rails —
which the fanout cut correctly drops. Body obstruction and airwire crossing are
two different measurements, and only `corridor_intrusions` was ever measuring
the first.

**3. It does change the placement — and the gain does not survive.** The first
A/B reported the term completely inert, and *that run was wrong*: it had been
pointed at `sdram_*`, a merged glob whose `cover` is 0.46, i.e. a phantom
corridor. Re-run against `SDRAM_A*` and `SDRAM_D*` declared separately, the
term moves parts on every board — and the independent grade says:

| board | crossings | hpwl | `bus_foreign_crossings` (re-derived) |
|---|---|---|---|
| ulx3s | 2417 → 2390 | 7512 → **7634** | 62 → **63** |
| orangecrab_ext_pll | 1051 → 1041 | 2120 → 2116 | 32 → **33** |
| kit-dev-coldfire | 1377 → 1371 | 7413 → 7219 | 148 → 143 |

One board of three improved the number the term exists to improve. **The
mechanism is the frozen model:** the optimizer minimises the cut against
corridors frozen at construction, but the corridor is *defined by the pads of
the bus*, so when parts move the corridor moves with them and the grader's
re-derived rectangle is not the one that was minimised. Freezing is still
required — an unfrozen corridor makes the objective non-stationary — so the
term is caught between two necessities.

Worth keeping from run 3: **a term that helps on one board of three is not a
term.** The `corridor-coldfire` row stays in the A/B table precisely because it
disagrees with the other two; dropping the disagreeing row is how a one-in-three
result becomes folklore about a term that "works".

So the cut ships as a **diagnostic**, not as an objective term:

- `check_floorplan --intent --health` reports `cut_mm` per corridor. It is
  strictly the better of the two numbers to *read* — it prices obliqueness, and
  on two layers it is the geometric lower bound on reference-plane copper the
  crossing removes, which is exactly what `check_impedance.py`'s void-run
  counter grades later.
- Alongside it, `cover`: the fraction of a bus's own pads that actually sit at
  the corridor's endpoints. `corridors_from_intent` will build a confident
  rectangle for any set of nets, including six identical motor channels
  scattered over a board whose endpoint centroids average to the middle of
  nothing (splitflap `OUT_*`: 24 nets, cover 0.0). Below `CORRIDOR_MIN_COVER`
  the corridor is reported as `bus_corridors_phantom` so it can be disbelieved
  rather than silently graded. Related trap from the same survey: **do not
  merge sub-buses.** `SDRAM_*` scores cover 0.62 where `SDRAM_A*` and
  `SDRAM_D*` separately score 1.0, because address and data leave the part on
  different faces and the average lands between them.
- `--corridor-weight` remains, default 0.0, flagged experimental with this
  result in its `--help`. It is kept rather than deleted because the kernel is
  exact and tested, and because a future move set that can relocate a part
  *across* a bus is exactly the regime where the term would bite.

Two design points that were right and are worth keeping if anyone revisits it:

- **The corridors are frozen at `QuenchState.__init__` and never rebuilt.**
  `_cluster_ends` derives endpoints from live pad positions, so a corridor that
  followed its parts would make the cost of a pose depend on *when* it was
  evaluated — an accepted gain would not match the recomputed total and the
  descent could cycle. Freezing makes that impossible rather than avoided by
  discipline.
- **The check must not be the model.** `check_floorplan --intent --health`
  re-derives corridors from the *final* poses, so it cannot be gamed by the
  frozen rectangles the optimizer minimised against. That independence is what
  let the A/B return "improved nothing" instead of a flattering self-report.

### Metric cheat-sheet

| Metric | Cost per move | Routability signal at PCB scale | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|
| HPWL / airwire length | O(1) incremental | Necessary, far from sufficient (exact only for 2–3 pin nets; congestion-blind) | Always include |
| Airwire pin-pair crossings | O(moved part's segments) | Best single PCB proxy (Cypress, NS-Place); grounded in planarity theory | Primary second objective |
| Pad/pin density map | ~free | Captures BGA/connector escape limits and fanout room | Cheap secondary term |
| RUDY congestion map | O(1) incremental rect update | Misses pin-pair conflicts on few-layer boards (Cypress Fig. 3) | Tiebreaker only |
| Steiner trees (FLUTE) | ~10× HPWL | Marginal over HPWL — PCB nets are mostly 2-pin | Skip |
| ML routability predictor | ms inference | Beats proxies (MIT thesis: NN trained on 75k *routed* placements) but needs per-board-family training data | Only if labels are cheap |
| Actual routing | seconds–minutes per candidate | Ground truth | Rank finalists, not per-move |

## Proposed shape of a `place_optimize.py`

Seeded SA — or a plain greedy quench first (VPR's `--place_quench_only`
precedent), which is simpler and may capture most of the value:

- **Moves** (the TimberWolf/Kahng-Cheng canon, adapted to PCB):
  - *nudge*: translate within a window that shrinks as temperature drops;
    optionally bias toward the part's optimal region (median of connected
    nets' bounding boxes — O(pins) to compute)
  - *rotate*: 0/90/180/270, relative to the part's own placement angle (a
    45°-placed part rotates on the 45/135/225/315 lattice, so deliberate
    non-orthogonal placement is preserved rather than snapped to the axes)
  - *swap*: same-footprint pairs (footprint-identical R/C swaps are free
    wins; mixed-size swaps are usually illegal anyway, so restrict by
    footprint compatibility)
  - *side flip* (optional; mirrored courtyard): treated as a first-class move
    in recent PCB literature. **Not implemented as a move.** Board side *is*
    now modelled by the clearance/halo terms (#456): a part occupies its own
    side with its courtyard and the far side only with its drilled-pad box, so
    cross-side parts no longer collide or repel — but nothing flips a part.
  - *rigid-group moves*: an IC plus its decoupling caps moves as one
    super-component. **Translation is implemented** (`--group-by`, #459);
    rigid *rotation* of a block is not. Blocks come from KiCad `(group ...)`,
    the schematic sheet path, net-name prefixes, or decap-to-IC tethering —
    see `placement/groups.py`. Off by default. The block is capped so every
    member stays within `--max-displacement` of its own seed, which keeps the
    neighbour-list pruning exact; the unbounded block relocation #459 also
    describes (an 80mm move) is separate, unimplemented work.
- **Constraints by construction, not penalty** (the discipline from analog-IC
  placement and Synopsys ICC relative-placement groups: encode constraints
  into the move generator so every perturbation is feasible, rather than
  penalizing violations):
  - respect `locked` flags (already parsed by `placement/parser.py`)
  - `--max-displacement` radius from the seed position — enforced for every
    move type, swaps included — so output reads as "your placement, nudged"
    and inherited human constraints survive
  - courtyard non-overlap via the existing rect machinery — side-aware, and
    against the real Edge.Cuts outline rather than an inset of the bounding box
    (`placement/legality.py`, #456). A part sitting off the board is not frozen:
    it may move strictly back toward the board. An overlapping one still may
    only move to a fully legal pose.
  - decaps tethered to their IC. **Implemented as a grouping source**
    (`--group-by decap`, #459): a 2-pad cap within 5mm of an IC's bounding box
    AND sharing a net with it. Both halves matter — across the corpus a cap sits
    0.0-2.6mm (median) from the nearest IC and shares a net with it 93-100% of
    the time, and the net check is what rejects the rest (13 of ulx3s' 70). It
    makes the block move together; it is not a constraint on the per-part nudge.
  - rotation disabled per-class where assembly conventions matter
    (`--no-rotate`, which also restricts same-footprint swaps to equal-angle
    pairs, since a swap exchanges full poses)
- **Cost**: Δ(crossings)·penalty + Δ(airwire length) + density/halo term —
  all incrementally updatable (only airwires touching the moved part's nets
  change). Mostly already in `rust_placer`; extending the scorer to evaluate
  a *perturbation* rather than a candidate position is a modest change, and
  it's a separate crate from the router.
- **Schedule**: VPR-style adaptive — T_init from cost σ over random moves,
  hold acceptance near 0.44, moves/temperature ∝ N^(4/3) (trivial at N ≈
  100), exit at T < 0.005·cost/N_nets. Or skip all of it and quench.
- **Validation loop**: after optimization, run `route.py` on before/after and
  report completion % and failed-net count. The Cypress benchmark suite (10
  open boards, 41–476 components, with KiCad converters) gives ready-made
  test cases beyond our own boards.

### Role of AI

Two distinct roles, kept separate:

- *Seed generation*: the existing `place_components_initially` (greedy
  constructive: descending pin count, connectivity-weighted centroid target,
  4 rotations, crossings+length scoring) is plausible for simple boards; keep
  `place.py` as a seed generator and fallback, not the headline feature.
- *Constraint extraction* — the more interesting angle: the project already
  has skills doing per-component datasheet lookup (`analyze-power-nets`,
  `identify-diff-pairs`). The same pattern could emit a placement-constraint
  file: which parts are decaps and whose IC they tether to, which clusters
  are switcher hot-loops that must move as rigid groups or not at all, which
  connectors should be locked. That directly attacks the constraint-capture
  problem that killed every previous autoplacer, and feeds the optimizer
  exactly the lock/tether/group inputs it needs. (Quilter's "circuit
  comprehension" — auto-detect bypass caps, diff pairs, power nets, then have
  the user verify — is the commercial version of this idea.)

## What to avoid

- **RL**: the startups (Quilter, DeepPCB, Flux) bet on it, but the best
  peer-reviewed result (Cypress) is non-RL; Quilter takes hours per board
  with hard size limits (<1,000 pins, ~100 components, 2.6 h for a
  176-component board as independently tested in 2024); and the Google
  chip-RL saga showed well-tuned SA matches or beats it given equal compute.
  We also have no training data.
- **Analytical/gradient placement** (DREAMPlace-style): needs Cypress-level
  engineering plus GPU plus multi-objective Bayesian hyperparameter search to
  work on PCBs — itself an admission that gradient methods are
  tuning-fragile at this scale. Wrong tool for N ≈ 100.
- **From-scratch placement of complex boards**: see constraint capture above.
- One framing note from the practitioner forums: the word "autoplacer" is
  culturally radioactive — "placement optimizer" that visibly preserves the
  user's layout is the framing people accept.

## First experiment

Cheap and decisive: take a hand-placed board, run a greedy quench with just
nudge+rotate+swap moves against the existing crossings+length scorer, and
measure route completion before/after with `route.py`. That one number tells
us whether the whole direction is worth building out. If the proxy improves
but route completion doesn't, add the spreading term before anything else —
that's the documented failure mode of wirelength-driven placement.

## Experiment results (June 2026)

Implemented as `place_optimize.py` + `placement/quench.py`: greedy quench
(nudge within `--max-displacement` of the seed, 90° rotations with correct
pad-angle rewriting, displacement-capped same-footprint swaps), cost =
`length_weight`·airwire
length + `crossing_penalty`·crossings + pin-count-scaled halo + soft edge
margin. Both airwire terms take optional per-net weights: a net's length is
multiplied by its weight, and each crossing is priced at the larger of the
two crossing nets' weights, so an unweighted board is untouched
(max(1, 1) = 1). Test board: `interf_u` (25 parts, PGA120 + bus connectors, 2 layers),
pipeline `route_planes` → `bga_fanout U9` → `route.py` with the
`tests/test_interf_u.py` arguments. Router iterations ≈ effort; vias and
completion are the quality metrics.

| placement | single-ended | multipoint pads | vias | router iterations |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| hand (KiCad demo) | 108/108 | 80/80 | 136 | 2.3 M |
| hand + quench, default weights | 106/108 (2 fail) | 80/80 | 150 | 3.1 M |
| hand + quench, strong halo | 100% of attempted | — | 157 | 6.7 M |
| hand + quench, crossing-focused¹ | 108/108 | 80/80 | 135 | 2.6 M |
| `place.py` from-scratch seed | 106/108 (2 fail) | 65/77 (12 fail) | 202 | 1 141 M |
| from-scratch seed + quench¹ | 108/108 | 71/80 (9 fail) | 240 | 364 M |

¹ `--length-weight 0.3 --crossing-penalty 30 --halo-weight 10 --halo-coef 0.5 --edge-halo 3`

**Conclusions:**

1. **The hand placement is dramatically better than from-scratch constructive
   placement** — 500× less router effort, no failures. The constraint-capture
   story is real even on a 25-part board: the human's bus-flow arrangement
   (BUS1 → buffers → PGA → RAM) is what makes it routable, and its
   "suboptimal" wirelength is buying that structure.
2. **Quenching an already-good seed is neutral at best.** Proxy improvements
   (crossings −13%, length −12%) did not translate: default weights *caused*
   2 failures, strong-halo variants tripled router effort. The
   crossing-focused parameter set merely matched the hand placement. On a
   board with no completion headroom there is nothing for the proxy to win,
   and chasing it perturbs structure the proxies can't see.
3. **Quenching a mediocre seed genuinely helps**: from-scratch + quench fixed
   both single-ended failures, cut multipoint failures 12 → 9, and reduced
   router effort 3× (1 141 M → 364 M iterations). Refinement works exactly
   where the literature says it does — when there is headroom.
4. **Proxy–routability correlation is weak**, confirming the MIT-thesis
   finding: the variant with the *best* crossing reduction (length weight 0)
   failed 2 nets. Any production version of this tool should rank candidate
   placements by an actual trial route (our router does this board in ~1–2 s
   of routing time), not by the proxy alone.

**Practical upshot:** ship the quench as a *repair* tool for rough/generated
placements (imported or auto-generated layouts), not as a polish pass on
careful hand placements. (Based on these results, the from-scratch
constructive placer — `place.py` and the `rust_placer` scoring crate — was
subsequently removed from the repo; it survives in git history.) The next-step experiments are (a)
router-in-the-loop candidate ranking, since single routes are cheap, and
(b) a proxy that models *escape/fanout room* around high-pin-count parts
explicitly rather than via the generic halo.

### Second board: kit-dev-coldfire-xilinx_5213 (160 parts, 4 layers)

Setup: `tests/test_kit_route.py` signal-stage arguments; connectors/headers
locked via `--lock`; plane-routed nets excluded from airwire scoring via
`--ignore-nets GND +3.3V` (both options added for this experiment). All
quench runs use the crossing-focused weights (`--length-weight 0.3
--crossing-penalty 30`).

| variant | single-ended | multipoint | vias | router iterations | route time |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| hand (KiCad demo) | 204/207 (3 fail) | 227/227 | 346 | 122 M | 45 s |
| quench, 3 mm cap, modest halo | 205/207 (2 fail) | 235/236 (1 fail) | 346 | **24.6 M** | 13 s |
| quench, 5 mm cap, modest halo | 204/207 (3 fail) | 223/227 (4 fail) | 331 | 22.4 M | 10 s |
| quench, 10 mm cap, strong halo | **192/207 (15 fail)** | 222/226 (4 fail) | 334 | 235 M | 97 s |

**Dose–response is the story.** At a 3 mm displacement cap the quench matches
the hand placement's completion while cutting router effort **5×** (122 M →
24.6 M iterations) — on this denser board the crossing reduction (−11%)
translates into real router savings, unlike on interf_u. At 5 mm it's
marginally worse on completion but keeps the effort win. At 10 mm with strong
halos, 149 of 150 movable parts moved and the placement collapsed: 12 of the
15 new failures were `/xilinx/XIL_D*` — the quench had destroyed the data-bus
corridor between the Xilinx and the MCU, exactly the macro structure the
crossing/length/halo proxies cannot see. (Failed-net identities vary between
runs near the noise floor; the iteration counts are the robust signal.)

Refined conclusions:

- `--max-displacement` is the dominant safety knob: small caps keep the
  human's macro structure (bus corridors, cluster geometry) intact by
  construction, which is the entire value of seeding from a human placement.
  ~3 mm was the sweet spot on both boards tested. The cap is now airtight:
  no move type — swaps included — can take a part beyond it, and
  `--swap-max-displacement` can tighten (never exceed) it for swaps
  specifically. The router-in-the-loop widening below widens **nudges only**:
  the swap cap holds at its base value for the whole run.
- The big halos backfire on dense boards: with `--halo-coef 0.5` the
  144-pin Xilinx demands a 6.5 mm halo that a dense board cannot satisfy, so
  the halo gradient dominates everything and scatters the layout. Modest
  halos (`--halo-coef 0.15`) only fire where parts are genuinely cramped.
- Lock connectors (`--lock`) and exclude plane-routed power nets
  (`--ignore-nets`) — both matter for honest objectives on real boards.

### Router-in-the-loop repair (`place_route_loop.py`)

The proxy-only results above motivated closing the loop: use the *router's
own failure diagnostics* to decide what to move. Each round:

1. Route the board; parse the run's JSON summaries and the frontier blocking
   analysis (which nets wall off each failed route). Note the plural:
   `route.py` runs an end-of-run reconciliation pass whenever the first pass
   left failures, and prints a second summary scoped to the retried nets.
   The failure lists in that last summary are the still-open set, while
   router effort adds across both passes.
2. Build the movable set: parts owning pads of the **failed nets** (move the
   endpoint out of the congested pocket) and of the **blocker nets** (move
   the anchor so the blocking wall re-routes) — excluding high-pin-count
   parts (`--max-target-pins 40`: moving a resistor that anchors a blocker
   is low-risk; dragging a 144-pin QFP is how placements get destroyed).
3. Micro-quench only those parts, with the failed nets weighted 3×
   (`--failed-net-weight`) — both their airwire *length* and any *crossing*
   they take part in, the latter priced at the larger of the two nets'
   weights. Weighting length alone was near-inert: at the loop's own knobs
   the crossing term is ~96% of the objective, so scaling a length
   coefficient from 0.3 to 0.9 against a crossing coefficient of 30 moved a
   typical failed net by less than the cost of a fifth of one crossing.
4. Re-route. Accept only if (failures, then iterations) improves; otherwise
   revert and widen the displacement cap 1.5× for the next attempt — the
   nudge radius only. The swap cap stays at its base value, so a widened
   round cannot become a long-range swap.

Result on kit-dev-coldfire from the hand placement (recorded before #458;
`failures` was then the pre-reconciliation count and `router iterations` the
first pass only, so both columns would read slightly differently today: fewer
failures where the reconciliation pass recovers a net, and more iterations
because that pass's own effort is now counted):

| round | action | failures | router iterations | vias |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | initial route | 3 | 122.4 M | 346 |
| 1 | moved 35 small parts near failed/blocker nets | 2 | 90.6 M | 360 | accepted |
| 2–3 | candidates worse (4, 3 failures) | — | — | — | rejected, cap widened |
| 4 | retry at 6.75 mm cap | **0** | **25.7 M** | 382 | accepted |

**The loop fully repaired the hand placement — 3 → 0 failed nets and 4.8×
less router effort — by moving only resistors/caps/jumpers** (49 parts
total; the ICs and connectors never moved). The reject-and-revert mechanism
did real work: two of four candidate placements made things worse and were
discarded, which is exactly the proxy-blindness the loop exists to catch.
Costs: +36 vias. (This run predates the swap displacement cap — one resistor
traveled 32 mm via an uncapped swap, which is what #430 fixed. Swaps are now
capped like every other move, and the loop holds that cap at its base value
while it widens the nudge radius, #458.) DRC: the same PAD-SEGMENT
micro-overlap artifact the router produces on the baseline (16 occurrences)
appears somewhat more often on the repaired board (30).

This validates the core hypothesis of the whole investigation: **proxies
propose, the router disposes.** Wall-clock cost was ~5 routing runs
(~4 minutes total on this board).

## The portfolio: diversity without giving up determinism

Everything above converges on ONE answer: the quench is a zero-temperature
greedy descent, deliberately de-randomized (#457), so the same board and
knobs produce the same placement byte for byte. That is the right property
for reproducibility and exactly the wrong one for exploring — a re-run can
never say "here is a different arrangement worth considering".

`place_portfolio.py` injects diversity at the SEED instead of un-suppressing
it in the engine, which keeps both properties at once:

- Each candidate is a legal perturbation of the input placement — `jitter`
  (seeded disc offsets of the free parts), `poses` (rotation variants of the
  highest-pin free parts, pruned by `pair_order.ref_inversions` so a
  rotation that provably raises the forced-crossing floor is never even
  quenched), `swap` (position exchanges inside a declared block, the move
  the quench's own displacement-capped swap phase cannot reach).
- Every candidate is then quenched by the ORDINARY engine — `quench.py` is
  not modified, and a default `place_optimize.py` run is bit-identical with
  the portfolio in the tree.
- Randomness is scoped, never ambient: candidate i draws from
  `random.Random(f"{seed}:{i}:{strategy}")`, so the portfolio is a pure
  function of (board, knobs, seed) and any single candidate replays alone
  via `--only i`. `tests/test_portfolio_determinism.py` pins this across
  PYTHONHASHSEED values, test_457-style.
- Ranking is a lexicographic tuple of numbers this document already
  establishes as trustworthy — crossings, the inversion lower bound, hpwl,
  the floorplan health signals, displacement — and the top candidates are
  probe-ROUTED (`--route-top`, default 2), because proxies propose and the
  router disposes applies to a slate exactly as it applies to a single
  repair.

The perturb-then-descend shape is classical basin hopping (Wales & Doye) —
the "extend the scorer to evaluate a perturbation" note in the SA section
above, finally built, with the acceptance step replaced by an explicit
ranked presentation to the user.

`place_seed.py` is the same idea one step earlier: for a board with NO
placement yet, a declared floorplan intent (zones, edge bands, locks, decap
rules — `docs/floorplan-intent.md`) carries exactly the unmodeled
constraints whose absence makes naive from-scratch placement fail (see "Why
from-scratch autoplacement fails" above). The seeder turns the intent's
constructs into a legal, seeded initial placement, grades its own output
against the same intent, and hands the result to the portfolio. The
from-scratch verdict stands: unaided is still out of scope; *aided by a
declared intent* is now a supported path.

## Amendment (15 August 2026): what the from-scratch verdict does and does not cover

Two claims have been travelling together in this document, and they are not
the same claim. One is measured and stands. The other was never tested and is
now contradicted.

**Stands, unamended: a constructive ALGORITHM loses badly to a human.** The
table above (`place.py` from-scratch: 1,141 M router iterations against the
hand placement's 2.3 M, 500×, with 2 single-ended and 12 multipoint failures)
is a real measurement of a real placer, and nothing here re-opens it. The
constraint-capture argument at the top of this document also stands: enclosure
fit, connector positions, thermal, EMI zoning, datasheet hot-loop intent and
assembly access are genuinely not in the board file.

**Superseded: "therefore nothing can place from scratch."** That inference has
a hidden premise — that the constraint-consumer must be a solver, which needs
every constraint pre-formalised into rects and rules before it can use any of
them. That premise is what produces the death spiral recorded at the top of
this file ("by the time you've configured the rooms/keepouts/rules the tool
needs to do well, you've already placed the board by hand"). It was written
before anything could read a datasheet, a prompt, or a netlist's own naming.

What changed the measurement is not a better optimiser. It is that the
arrangement became **sayable**. Run 19's seeder could not produce a key field
(7 switches "no legal pose inside zone", 3 "no legal pose anywhere"), so the
arrangement was written as 221 lines of per-board arithmetic —
`wk/run19/urchin/arrange.py`, with `PITCH = 17.0`, `X0 = 46.0` and
`MIRROR_X = 17.599913 + 239.1983` baked in. That script was not a smarter
algorithm; it seated every pose through `seeder._try_place`, the engine's own
gate. It simply had a vocabulary the toolchain did not: a pitch, a mirror
axis, a rotation, and an origin *measured against the outline* rather than
authored.

Measured, same board, same engine gate, `py_placer/place_plan.py`:

| | arrange.py + apply_c2_seats.py | the plan |
|---|---|---|
| form | 221 + 148 lines, per board, throwaway | 22 declarative ops |
| seated | 80 | **82** |
| parked | SW17 SW34 D16 D17 D33 | D17 D33 D34 |

**That table is apples-to-apples (same board, clearance, edge and grid; both
address the same 85 refs) and the 82 is reproducible. The comparison is still
not evidence that the FORMAT places better, and an earlier revision of this
section claimed it was. Retracted, with the measurement that retracted it:**

The whole margin is one setting. SW17's pile rotation is 330° and SW34's is
15°, and `_try_place` searches `[rot, rot+90, rot+180, rot+270]`, so neither
part can reach 0° from its pile pose. The plan says `"rot": 0`; delete just
that and it drops to 79. But the hand script could say it too — it is Python
calling the same `_try_place`, and three lines setting `st.parts[ref].rot = 0`
for the switches take it to **82 with the identical park set**. Extend it to
the diodes and it reaches **84, parking only D17** — two better than the plan.
The plan's own vocabulary also reaches 84 (`place_relative` accepts `rot`), so
the shipped 22-op plan leaves two seats on the table that its own schema
expresses. `seeder.py:26-32` is about the INTENT schema, which genuinely
cannot express a rotation; it says nothing about a Python script.

So the defensible claim is narrower: the plan reproduces the hand script's
result through the engine's own gate, in a form that is inspectable, diffable
and replayable, with the loops and the mirror axis gone. It does not place
better. And 74 of the plan's 77 numeric literals appear verbatim in
`arrange.py` (the other 3 are that file's own computed values written out), so
what was eliminated is the ARITHMETIC, not the hand-chosen coordinates.

So the honest formulation of the verdict is narrower than what this document
has been read as saying:

> A constructive algorithm optimising a proxy places worse than a human, by a
> lot. That is measured and unchanged. It does not follow that from-scratch
> placement is out of reach — the constraints an algorithm cannot capture can
> be STATED, and stating them is cheaper than formalising them, because a
> statement may be structural ("5 columns at 17 mm pitch, mirrored") where a
> rule must be exhaustive.

What has NOT changed, and should not be read into the above:

- The plan's 22 ops still contain 17 hand-typed `place_at` coordinates, and
  `PITCH`, `X0` and the thumb-pocket coordinates are carried as literals. Only
  the mirror axis and the per-column stagger are genuinely derived. This is a
  better *form*, not yet a derivation.
- Nothing here supplies enclosure fit, thermal or EMI intent. Those still
  arrive from a human, and the plan gives them somewhere to land instead of an
  `arrange.py` constant.
- `place_seed` gained its own eviction rung after this amendment was first
  written (`--evict-depth`, default 1): stage 3c censuses the movable
  incumbents blocking a part with no legal pose, evicts up to
  `EVICT_MAX_BLOCKERS`, and retries, reporting `evictions` and
  `no_pose_blockers`. A file-locked incumbent is never evicted. Measured on
  piled real boards it does change the outcome — `sonde_u` 22 seated → **25,
  0 unseated** (3 evictions), `esp_prog` 14 → 15 — so the machinery is not
  plan-path-only.
  **It does NOT close #630, and this document should not be read as claiming
  it does.** On the 87-part urchin pile the issue actually names, `place_seed`
  did not terminate: two runs (eviction on and off) burned ~2 h 20 m wall each
  with no result, and bounded at `--deadline 900` it exited having seeded
  **28** with `evictions: 0` and an empty `no_pose_blockers` — the rung never
  fired because stage 3 never finished. #630's complaint is a REACHABILITY
  complaint, and the binding constraint on that board was non-termination, not
  the missing rung.

  **Since measured again at 77 of 87, same 900 s deadline** (8 unseated, 9
  never tried), after `_point_in_poly` was given a y-bucket edge index — it was
  60% of total runtime, an unindexed scan over a 638-edge outline at ~51.6 µs a
  call. That is a 2.75× improvement in parts seated and it does not close the
  issue: the deadline still expires. Two attempts at `--deadline 2700` are
  inconclusive rather than negative — both were killed by the measuring
  harness (one by a `head -6` closing the pipe, one by a background-task cap)
  at ~36 min while still progressing, so nothing is yet known about whether
  the board completes given more time. Do not cite 2700 s either way.

  (Also: `--evict-depth` is typed `int` but read as a boolean, so `5` behaves
  exactly like `1`.)
- Simultaneous routability is still not predicted. `loop_driver.py:1347-1350`
  says it: *"Both those tests are PER-NET, and simultaneous routability is not.
  A board can pass every one of them and still be unroutable."* The router
  remains the judge.

See `py_placer/placement/README.md` (`place_plan.py`) for the vocabulary, and
`tests/test_place_plan_urchin.py` for the measurement above.

## Roadmap: placement science after run 7 (August 2026)

Run 7 (the first clean-slate run whose placement this stack generated) and
the discussion-#118 thread converged on the same diagnosis: the candidate
score is built from signal proxies while several measured placement
failures live elsewhere. Ordered by cost-to-value, cheapest first; item 1
is implemented, the rest are documented targets.

1. **Plane fragility in the candidate score — implemented** (`--plane-score`
   on `place_portfolio.py`, backed by `plane_score.py`). Quench and
   portfolio were plane-blind while the router-side #424 machinery already
   prices exact fill damage. The score pours the declared plane nets on a
   scratch copy (KiCad ZONE_FILLER refill), and folds (islands, neck sum)
   into `rank_key` — islands before hpwl, neck sum after it. Trust it only
   after calibration on boards with a measured probe order (run 7's seed
   archive is the first known-answer case).

2. **Channel occupancy as a nonlocality proxy.** *(partly done —
   `--corridor-weight`, below. What remains is occupancy against a capacity,
   which needs the escape-lane supply model; the cut term prices damage, not
   fullness.)* A candidate that fills a corridor past capacity fails ROUTING
   nonlocally — the failure surfaces on whatever net routes last, far from the
   part that caused it (run 7's west-fan capacity finding is exactly this
   shape).

2b. **Constrained-part re-seating** (`placement/reseat.py`). *Done.* The
   observation it comes from: parts under a proximity rule are **locked**,
   because the quench has no proximity term and will otherwise walk a different
   member past the limit every run — lock one and the next moves. That works,
   and it freezes exactly the parts whose re-seating produced most of run 8's
   placement wins.

   The move that removes the need for both the locks and a proximity cost term:
   **make the proximity rule the definition of the slot pool.** Slots are
   generated on rings around the anchor's relevant *pins* (not its centre — that
   would send a decap to the middle of the die), so every candidate satisfies
   the constraint by construction and there is nothing to price.

   What remains is an assignment problem, and it is exactly additive: each
   member is scored with every other member's pads overridden to an **empty
   list**, which removes them from the airwire model. No member–member term ⇒
   Hungarian-legal. The constant the rows share (the rest of the board's
   contribution to the same nets) is uniform across the matrix, and Hungarian is
   invariant to adding a constant everywhere. `scipy.linear_sum_assignment` when
   present, deterministic greedy otherwise — KiCad's bundled Python has no
   scipy and this runs on the same paths.

   Three properties that make it safe rather than merely clever: identity is
   always in the pool, so "leave it alone" is a possible answer; **acceptance is
   on the exact cluster objective**, re-evaluated with every member in place, so
   a lying surrogate can waste time but can never ship a worse board; and there
   is no RNG anywhere.

   **The limit, stated rather than left to be discovered:** the objective is the
   cluster's airwire cost, so the cluster must carry a net worth scoring. The
   only tether source in-repo is `decap_tethers`, and a decoupling cap's two
   nets are *rails* — which the fanout cut correctly drops, because scoring a
   pose against a 96-part GND MST measures distance from the middle of the
   board. Those clusters report that and are left alone, which is right: where a
   decap sits is governed by its pin, and the slot pool already guarantees that.
   The mechanism earns its keep on clusters carrying **signal** nets (series
   terminations, filter networks, a part tethered to a zone), and it is generic
   over `(member, anchor, radius)`, so a new tether source needs no change here.

   Two traps, both found by writing the tests rather than by reasoning:
   Hungarian returns distinct slot *indices*, which is not the same as
   non-overlapping courtyards, so members are seated one at a time with an
   explicit check against the poses already assigned (`state.parts` still holds
   the old ones) and the bumps are reported as `repairs` rather than hidden. And
   snapping a ring to the placement grid moves a point by up to half a cell per
   axis, so slots generated *at* the radius land outside it — the pool shrinks
   by the snap diagonal, or the by-construction claim is false at exactly the
   outer ring where a re-seat wants to look.

3. **The #411 undo-a-known-good-placement harness — BUILT.** See "What the
   #411 harness measured" below. `placement/perturb.py` manufactures the bad
   seed, `placement/recovery.py` grades it against the original, and
   `tests/stress/perturb_batch.py` walks the skill's Step 0 ladder over the
   result. The first two batches are in; the headline is that no arm in the
   toolbox recovers a displaced floorplan, and that this is a missing objective
   term rather than a tuning problem.

4. **Per-component best-location heatmap** (the #118 ask): for a chosen
   part, render the board as a heatmap of the candidate score over
   positions (with matching JSON), so a human can SEE why the optimizer
   wants a part somewhere — and where the score is flat, which is where
   declared intent has to carry the decision.

5. **Part-class rule table as seeder configuration.** #118's taxonomy:
   different part classes obey different placement logic (decap ≠ connector
   ≠ crystal ≠ series termination). The seeder hardcodes a version of this;
   making it a declared table would let a repo tune class behavior without
   engine edits.

## What the #411 harness measured

*(First results, August 2026. Boards: `tigard`, `splitflap_driver` and
`glasgow_revC` — the last two are stress set-1 members. Ground truth is each
board's own shipped placement; `recovery = 1 − d_after/d_applied_dose` in
pad-space RMS, so 1.0 is a full recovery, 0 inert, negative worse than the
perturbed board. Scoreboard: `$STRESS_DIR/perturb/scoreboard.jsonl`,
append-only, keyed by `code_version`.)*

**Nothing recovers. Every proxy says otherwise.**

| arm | recovery (3–6 cells) | median | crossings improved | routing failures improved |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `place_optimize --max-displacement 3` (Step 0c's command) | −0.062 … +0.023 | −0.005 | 6/6 | — |
| `place_optimize` at a cap matched to the dose | −0.215 … +0.301 | −0.087 | 6/6 | — |
| `place_route_loop` shipped | −0.001 … +0.029 | +0.001 | 3/3 | 3/3 |
| `place_route_loop --target-nets` | −0.107 … +0.047 | +0.001 | 3/3 | 3/3 |
| `place_route_loop` cap matched, pin gate lifted, blocks on | −0.689 … +0.161 | −0.052 | 3/3 | 3/3 |

`R_pose(recovery ≥ 0.5)` is **None for every arm at every dose tested.**

Two findings follow, and they are different in kind.

**The quench optimises away from the answer.** Crossings fell in 6 of 6 cells
(median −18.5% at the prescribed cap, −33.1% at a capable one) while
displacement-to-original improved in 1 of 6. Three arms *beat the human
placement* on crossings while sitting further from it than the perturbed board
they started from — tigard/swap 267 vs 276, splitflap/translate 55 vs 123,
glasgow/translate 563 vs 785. Overlap falls in every cell too, so without a
pose metric this reads as success on every legality and crossing number
available. This is the document's own "proxies propose, the router disposes",
measured against ground truth instead of argued from anecdote — and the cause is
structural: **the objective has no displacement-from-seed term, so nothing pulls
a part back**, and on a wrong floorplan the crossing gradient points away.

**The loop compensates rather than recovers, and that is not a defect.**
`loop@allon` took tigard from 13 routing failures to 2 — the best-routing board
in the experiment — at a recovery of −0.052; on glasgow it took 19 → 11 while
moving parts 69% further out. The loop makes a wrong floorplan routable *in
place*. Nothing in its objective rewards placement fidelity, so `compensated` is
a first-class verdict here, not a shortfall.

That also settles #411's own stated prediction — *"at block scale
`--max-target-pins 40` recovers none of them, because the part that needs to
move is never a passive"* — as **right about the outcome, wrong about the
mechanism**. Lifting the gate improved routing enormously (13→12 becomes 13→2)
and left recovery at −0.052. Removing a filter on *which* parts may move cannot
produce recovery when no term rewards moving them back.

Three smaller results worth keeping:

- **A loop cannot see a floorplan that is wrong but still routable.** A scoped
  route of a perturbed board returned `failures=0`, so the loop printed "No
  failures left - stopping" at `rounds_run=0` and returned its input byte for
  byte. Its move candidates come only from failed and blocking nets, so the pin
  gate was never even consulted. `--target-nets` is the documented answer and it
  works: on both smaller boards the targeted arm beat the shipped one on the
  router's own terms (tigard 13→8 vs 13→12; splitflap 10→5 vs 10→9).
- **A rigid block translate barely moves on a packed board.** Feasible doses
  before a member leaves the outline: 1.40 mm for coldfire's 21-part sheet
  block, 5.10 mm for glasgow's 67-part anchor unit — far below #411's proposed
  5/10/20/40/80 ladder, because a shipped board has nowhere to translate into.
  `swap`, which exchanges two units and changes no net area, reaches 14–66 mm.
  The block-scale ladder is a per-(board, unit) property, not a constant.
- **Cost goes as `(cap/step)²`, so a bigger cap is not a slower run.**
  `loop@allon` searched a 7.9× larger radius and ran **4.6× faster** than
  `loop@shipped` (185 s vs 846 s) because `--step` scaled with the cap. Step 0c
  prescribes `--max-displacement` and never mentions `--step`.

**What this says about Step 0c's acceptance rule.** It accepts on
`crossings_after ≤ crossings_before` and `hpwl_after ≤ hpwl_before`. On
splitflap/swap both improve while the board is 91% un-recovered, so the rule
green-lights every run above. Two numbers produced by the optimizer cannot
adjudicate a property the optimizer has no term for — which is the same lesson
this document already records for the decap case, now with a second instance.

## Update: hard pad+drill legality (default on)

The quench, seeder and portfolio now share a pad+drill legality layer
(`placement/legality.py`: `PartPads`/`LegalityContext`/`grade_pad_legality`) —
courtyard-only gating is history (`--courtyard-only` restores it for A/B).
New repair entry points: `place_seed --repair` (violation-driven,
minimal-move) and `place_reconstruct.py` (structural reconstruction with an
exact assignment solve). Anti-churn: `--min-gain-per-mm`. Mounting holes are
frozen by default (`--move-unconnected` frees them). Full design notes and
measured acceptance numbers: `placement/README.md`.
